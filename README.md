# Making History
This repository hosts a test website that provides an introduction to historiography---or the history of history and how its been written. The website draws from several versions of a [historiography course](http://fredgibbs.net/courses/historiography) from the [History Department](http://history.unm.edu) at the [University of New Mexico](http://unm.edu).
