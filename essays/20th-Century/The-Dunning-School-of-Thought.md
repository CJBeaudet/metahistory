The subject of my essay will be the **Dunning School of Thought**. The Dunning School of Thought is classified as period of time between the 1890’s to 1960’s where there was blatant racism in historical scholarship of slavery, the Civil War, and Reconstruction. The Dunning School of Thought can be tracked to William Archibald Dunning: the first Reconstruction historian whose combination of skill, popularity, and charm would elevate his racist historical work to that of archetypical status among the historical community. Dunning’s professor position at Columbia University along with his various roles of leadership in the *American Historical Association* and *Political Science Quarterly* would provide the perfect setting for Dunning to amass a large sphere of influence. This influence would propagate in his many students/ disciples who would become the first of many exponentially growing waves of racist scholarship in American history. 

When it comes to the history of Reconstruction scholarship – a relatively new field of study- modern historians can track the prevalence of different ideologies into three general categories: the Dunning Era, the Revisionists, and the Post-Revisionists. I intend to primarily focus on the Dunning Era and the resulting consequences of that era for the historical community thereafter. I will define the Revisionists and Post-Revisionists in connection to their role of “fixing” the harm that the Dunning School of Thought instigated. The Dunning Era would completely shape historical biases and methodologies for the field of Reconstruction scholarship for decades. **It’s impact, while lessened by the Revisionists and Post-Revisionists, can still be seen today.**
