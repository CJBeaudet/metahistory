## Abstract

On August 24, 1902, a school teacher and his wife in Lumeville, France gave birth to a boy who would become one of the most influential historians of the 20th century. His name was Fernand Paul Braudel and his scholarship changed the way the world viewed historical time and space. Emphasizing geography and climate over political or economic events, Braudel worked in long time scales over massive spatial regions. As a leading member of the Annales School, Braudel stressed an interdisciplinary social sciences approach and quantitative methodologies. 

Beginning in 1923, he taught first in Algiers and then in Sao Paolo, Brazil where he met his mentor, the renowned French historian and founder of the Annales School, Lucien Fevbre. Called to service for the French Army in 1940, Braudel was taken prisoner by Nazis and spent the next five years as a prisoner of war in Germany. During captivity, he drafted his magnum opus *The Mediterranean and the Mediterranean World in the Time of Phillip II* on notebooks that were smuggled out to Febvre. After his release, Braudel joined Febvre as codirector of the Annales journal and delved deeper into his academic career both as a professor and later as founder of the Maison des Sciences de lâ€™Homme. 

Braudel was a prolific writer known as much for his beautiful narrative prose as for his revolutionary perspectives on historical time. Other than *The Mediterranean*, his two most significant works are *Civilization and Capitalism* and *The Identity of France*. He died in November 1985 at the age of 83.
