## Introduction and historical context

In many cases in the study of historiography, the whole of the period from the fall of Rome to the beginning of the Renaissance, and the revolution in thought that it heralded, are ignored. ‘Historians’ in the medieval era are derided as mere chroniclers, or else so biased or backwards in their finished works and methodology alike as to be beneath notice. 

However, this is not strictly the case. There were many medieval historians whose methods and works might be thought of as ‘ahead of their time’. One such scholar is [Bede](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bede) (c. 672-735), commonly known as ‘the Venerable Bede.” Born in the north of England, in what was then the independent kingdom of Northumbria, Bede entered the monastery of Monkwearmouth at the age of seven, and later moved to its twin monastery of Jarrow when it was founded in 682. He remained in the monastic system his whole life. 


## *The Ecclesiastical History of the English People* and its methodology and influences

Bede’s most well-known work was the [*Ecclesiastical History of the English People*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecclesiastical_History_of_the_English_People). This seminal work, completed just around 731, just a few years before Bede’s death, displays the advanced methodology that Bede is renowned for. 

## Bede's popularization of the *Anno Domini* system of dating

In Bede’s time, the computation of dates, particularly of [Easter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computus), was a matter of prime importance, and no small amount of controversy, to the Church. Differences in the method of determining Easter had often led to doctrinal conflict. One such conflict in England in the late 7th Century AD led to the [Synod of Whitby](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synod_of_Whitby), a council meeting of clergymen. This incident would clearly have a great effect on Bede. Not only would he write about it in his *Ecclesiastical History*, but he would devote a great deal of effort in his other writings to determining the date of Easter specifically, and to the issues of dating in general. 

In 725, Bede wrote [The Reckoning of Time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Reckoning_of_Time), (*De temporum ratione* in the original Latin), which among much else promoted the use of a novel system for dating years, which had been created by a fellow monk, [Dionysius Exiguus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dionysius_Exiguusnysius_Exiguus) (c. 470-c. 544). In this system, years are numbered from the incarnation of Jesus Christ, and described with the phrase *anno Domini*, “in the Year of our Lord”.
