## Introduction and historical context

In many cases in the study of historiography, the whole of the period from the fall of Rome to the beginning of the Renaissance, and the revolution in thought that it heralded, are ignored. ‘Historians’ in the medieval era are derided as mere chroniclers, or else so biased or backwards in their finished works and methodology alike as to be beneath notice. 

However, this is not strictly the case. There were many medieval historians whose methods and works might be thought of as ‘ahead of their time’. One such scholar is [Bede](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bede) (c. 672-735), commonly known as ‘the Venerable Bede.” Born in the north of England, in what was then the independent kingdom of Northumbria, Bede entered the monastery of Monkwearmouth at the age of seven, and later moved to its twin monastery of Jarrow when it was founded in 682. By the age of 30, around 703, Bede was ordained as a priest, and among his other duties he “was particularly drawn to study, teaching, and writing” (Farmer, 20). 


## *The Ecclesiastical History of the English People* and its methodology and influences

Bede’s most well-known work was the [*Ecclesiastical History of the English People*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecclesiastical_History_of_the_English_People). This seminal work, completed just around 731, just a few years before Bede’s death, displays the advanced methodology that Bede is renowned for. It is admittedly flawed by modern standards, and it is not as groundbreaking as later author's and their works would be, but for its time, it remarkable.

As a work of history, *Bede’s Ecclesiastical History of the English People* can be considered among the best examples of a medieval history, while displaying amny of the flaws inherent to the style, such as “regional bias, [Bede’s] academic partisanship, and the paucity of his sources” (Farmer, 23). Bede, who died before the unification of Anglo-Saxon England, was biased towards his own kingdom of Northumbria, and emphasizes events there at the expense of some of the other realms in Britain. That said, it is clearly written and, and was both widely admired and widely copied at the time of its writing. Some 150 years after it was written, the *Ecclesiastical History* was translated from its original Latin into Old English, in support of the educational efforts of King Alfred the Great. 

The best examples of Bede’s historiographical contributions come from his Preface to the *Ecclesiastical History*. Here, he clearly states his sources, explicitly “in order to avoid any doubts in the mind… of any who may listen to or read this history, as to the accuracy of what I have written” (Ecclesiastical History, 41). Though he is not as critical as some later historiographer, such as Ranke, might have insisted on, by showing where he drew his information from, Bede allows later historians to do the work that he likely did not think to do, of analyzing those sources and determining whether the information they related was accurate. Some of Bede’s sources were narrative in form, and these are the least reliable. On the other hand, in the early chapters, Bede relies almost entirely on primary sources, letters to and from [Pope Gregory I]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Gregory_I) acquired from the papal archives in Rome by an associate of Bede’s, [Nothelm]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nothhelm). The last major type of source Bede had access to were eyewitness accounts, at most secondhand, of some of the later events he described. These events, more recent in Bede’s own time, such as the Synod of Whitby, would have been described to Bede, either by fellow monks who had witnessed them, or who themselves had known the participants. In this sense, then they can almost be viewed as oral histories. 

Bede also clearly states his purpose in writing his history. There are no questions about speculative philosophy of history for Bede, or rather, he provides a clear answer to the question of what history, or at least his history, is for. Dedicated to [Ceolwulf]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceolwulf_of_Northumbria), then king of Northumbria, Bede states unequivocally that “if history records good things of good men, the thoughtful hearer is encouraged to imitate what is good: or if it records evil of wicked men, the devout, religious listener or reader is encouraged to avoid all that is sinful and perverse and to follow what he knows to be good” ((Ecclesiastical History, 41).

## Bede's popularization of the *Anno Domini* system of dating

In Bede’s time, the computation of dates, particularly of [Easter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computus), was a matter of prime importance, and no small amount of controversy, to the Church. Differences in the method of determining Easter had often led to doctrinal conflict. One such conflict in England in the late 7th Century AD led to the [Synod of Whitby](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synod_of_Whitby), a council meeting of clergymen. This incident would clearly have a great effect on Bede. Not only would he write about it in his *Ecclesiastical History*, but he would devote a great deal of effort in his other writings to determining the date of Easter specifically, and to the issues of dating in general. 

In 725, Bede wrote [*The Reckoning of Time*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Reckoning_of_Time), (*De temporum ratione* in the original Latin), which among much else promoted the use of a novel system for dating years, which had been created by a fellow monk, [Dionysius Exiguus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dionysius_Exiguusnysius_Exiguus) (c. 470-c. 544). In this system, years are numbered from the incarnation of Jesus Christ, and described with the phrase *anno Domini*, “in the Year of our Lord”. 

Prior to Bede’s use of the AD system, and its ensuing popularization by Bede’s students, systems of numbering years were confused and complex. One common method was regnal dating, referring to years in reference to the reigns of kings or often popes. Bede himself uses this system, referring to events taking place in the “10th year of [Pope Gregory’s] reign”(Ecclesiastical 72) for example. This approach has obvious limitations. This way of numbering years in inherently reliant on references to kings or other rulers, and if a modern-day historian is unfamiliar with these figures, their job will be much more difficult.  

It’s worth noting here that the *anno Domini* system itself is just as reliant on a reference to a particular event, but the system has become so widespread, though the mechanisms first of colonialism and latterly of globalism, and in many instances divorced from its religious origins in the form of the related “Common Era” notation. That being said, the *anno Domini* system has become the de facto universal standard, used around the world, and the credit for its popularization can be placed firmly at the feet of Bede, and of many of his students and contemporary admirers, such as [Boniface]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Boniface), a notable monk and missionary to what is now Germany and the Netherlands, and [Alcuin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcuin), a scholar and one of the leading figures in the [Carolingian Renaissance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carolingian_Renaissance) of the late 8th and early 9th centuries.
