## Abstract

In my essay I will examine Bede’s practices as a historian, and how he used methods that would later be described as required, such as listing his sources, while nevertheless committing some the methodological sins. Because he did not directly promote his methods, and because he was, in common with many of his contemporaries, biased in his writings, he cannot be considered among the ranks of truly groundbreaking historical thinkers, but his practices and positive influences which reached as far as the oft-ignored Carolingian renaissance should not be ignored, especially in a resource such as this. Additionally, I will examine Bede’s promulgation of the now common-place Anno Domini system of dating years, as opposed to listing years by reference to the reigns of emperors or popes. His popularization of this system might in hindsight be his greatest achievement, though it does seem as dramatic or exciting to a modern observer.
