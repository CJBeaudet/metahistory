Historiographically speaking, there has been very little attention paid to women before the modern era. There are, however, exceptions, a key one being the history of female regents, and other female members of royal families. The treatment of Queens like Elizabeth I, Victoria, Isabella, and Catherine the Great serve as indicators and influencers for the overall view of women in the public reckoning. I will be examining contemporary accounts of these regents, as well as their interpretations by later historians.
