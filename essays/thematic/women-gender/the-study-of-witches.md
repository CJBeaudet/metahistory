Witches in a modern society are seen as unreasonable and illogical. To accuse someone of heresy in the modern time would turn heads but mostly out of concern for your mental health. Yet they are still constant concepts in fantasy shows, movies, books, and other genres of entertainment. The stereotypes that have been developing over time have shaped what women should not be like in order to stay apart of society. Though they have now grown into symbols of feminism and women strength with each new wave of feminism. These stereotypes and growth are not only seen in entertainment but in how their histories have been studied since the early nineteenth century. The fears and judgements that rang true in the 1500s and 1600s have not gone away but have built the current stereotypes and as historians gained more interest into identity work the stereotypes have changed.

In school in the United States, many of the exposure to witch trials comes from a brief overview of the [Salem Witch Trials](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/a-brief-history-of-the-salem-witch-trials-175162489/) in both history and occasionally english classes by reading _The Crucible_. These brief overviews glance over the massive impact the trials had on economics and women’s place in society. They introduce a difficult topic leaving most people's knowledge about the witch trials to be

While this idea is not totally inaccurate it **leaves out the years of work historians have been developing over time about the trials in Europe and Russia**. For the purpose of simplicity this essay will _focus less on Russia and more on the European front as the two don’t follow the same patterns_. 
# Important Texts and Early Writers
In order to study the trials, and any history really, people needed to search for [primary documents](https://umb.libguides.com/PrimarySources/secondary). These documents range from witch hunting guides to the trial records themselves. Depending on the geographical region, some had more documents than others.

Germany had over 30,000 accounts  of witch trials[^1] and executions during the long standing witch craze from 1500-1775. The Third Reich, with their heavy interest in all things science fiction to reality, did extensive research on witches to understand their potential benefit to their regime. They set up [Hexen Sonderkommando](https://www.pravdareport.com/society/123470-third_reich_witches/) which specializes in all things witches. From the trials to the executions to the general philosophical idea of what made a witch these sonderkommando was in charge of it. Of course, in true third reich fashion they maintained their focus on Germany and the preservation of its history.

Another very influential text to come from Germany was found much earlier than the rise of the Third Reich. [ The Malleus Maleficarum](https://www.thoughtco.com/malleus-maleficarum-witch-document-3530785) was the german witch hunters guide. This document was written in _**1486 and 1487** by two German Dominican monks, Heinrich Kramer and Jacob Sprenger_. Given this document was written after the Gutenberg Printing Press, it had an advantage over documents of a similar message. This also helped preserve the document in time as so many people believed in it and carried it through the times with them even after there were no more legal witch trials. Joseph Hansen, a german born historian, published the first major work on witch historiography utilizing the role the Malleus Maleficarum had on a society over run with fears against witchcraft. His book _**Zauberwahn, Inquisition und Hexenprozess im Mittelalter und die Entstehung der grossen Hexenverfolgung** (Magical Illusion, Inquisition, and Witch Trials in the Middle Ages, and the Formation of the Larger Persecution of Witches)_ was published in 1900 followed by his sourcebook in 1901, _Quellen und Untersuchungen zur Geschichte des Hexenwahns und der Hexenverfolgung im Mittelalter: Mit einer Untersuchung der Geschichte des Wortes Hexe_. His book **“identifies the accumulated beliefs of sorcery and heresy as comprising witchcraft in its fifteenth-century concept”**[^1]

In England, King James I of England, or VI of Scotland, wrote _**Daemonologie, In Forme of a Dialogue, Divided into three Books: By the High and Mighty Prince, Jame by the Grace of God King of England, Scotland, France,  and Ireland**_ . His purpose for writing this was to _” serue for a shew of my learning & ingine”_ [^2], an understanding and warning of/for witches. In his three books he structures his argument as describing magic, describing sorcery and witchcraft, and finishing with a description of spirits and specters [^3] The importance of this text is that it inspired many others to write on who were susceptible to the devils lure. This also influenced how people under King James I’s rule would hold trials and the proceedings by which they were accused. In history, by studying this document before studying the trials there is a sense of culture and a deeper look into the minds of the people during the witch craze.

# Postmodernism's Influence

Although the first major works about witches were published in 1900, falling within the modern period of historiography, witch historiography was greatly impacted by the postmodern movement emerging in the 1960's. Many historians interested in witches who came out of this period incorporated methods beyond history. In order to understand this psychological phenomenon many needed to understand psychology in general. Witch  historiography began to consider and incorporate topics such as **”history, anthropology, magic, popular superstitions, religion, theology, law, psychology, sexuality, gender, sociology, medicine, politics, loanguage, popular beliefs, folklore studies, and popular culture:** [^5] Aligning with the change from macro-history to micro-story during this time. Going from grand views of witches blending into society and plucking them out individually to see the “political, social, and economic context” [^4]. Historians exploring the effects of witches on society deduced a few things: 
- Witch hunts were based on class and economics
- Witch hunts played a significant role in forming the modern nation state
- Religion played a more significant role than gender [^6]

With these focuses in mind, most historical research has been influenced by those who came before going in and out of periods of assessing the role gender played in these hunts.

# Postmodern Historians

### The Economist View
The following historians primarily utilized the argument that the witch trials were completely economically based. Potential faults in their argument is the fact that they mostly ignore the other factors in the accused demographics.

[H.R Trevor-Roper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugh_Trevor-Roper) understood how “folk witch beliefs” were a product of “peasant credulity and feminine hysteria” [^7] and argued this in the study of witches. To him a witch was someone in a lower class who was seen as given an advantage in some way. Following Gustav Henningsen’s description that:
{% include aside.html
  class="pullquote"
  text=" Weakest members of the community, including beggars, cripples, widows, the very old and orphans… those who had rejected the moral order of society: fawning, envious, thieving, aggressive, spiteful, promiscuous and odd people; in fact all who were in any way unattractive. [^8]"
  %}
The language they predominantly used refrained from emphasizing feminine or masculine pronouns as their focus was on the social order of things and not on how gender played a role in those demographic analogies.

Keith Thomas and Alan Macfarlane had similar approaches to their study of witches while adhering to the Henningsen’s definition as well. Both incorporated fields outside of history to understand how the witch hunts impacted society but did not see that gender played a role in the ostration of who was accused. They applied “functionalist social anthropology and the african anthropological literature to European witchcraft”[^10]. Thomas noting that “female sexual irregularities-illegitimacy, promiscuity, sexual voracity-figured in the trials”[^9] set him up to see the potentially genered argument in sexuality chose instead to strengthen the theme of the separation of gender and sex. His contribution to the study of witches lies in how he interpreted the documentation to show patterns in social tensions in society that correlated with the rising stresses coming from the change in psychological thinking [^9]. Macfarlane took the basic assumptions about witches to explain their function in society [^12]. His focus was not to understand witchcraft but why witchcraft rose in popularity among the psyches of the people of the late middle ages and early modern era. Both historians took this seemingly micro ideology to explain the larger scheme in society. The lack of charity and the transition from feudalism to capitalism rendered much of the peasantry in a state of flux and displacement in location and class ranking [^11]

### Outside of Economics
As more women began to enter into the making of history, new perspectives on a women dominated subject began to change the mindsets of historians. Christina Larner focused on Scotish and English witch trials trying to understand them through a sociological, historical, and religious viewpoint [^17]. Although she did not conclude that the witch hunts were synonymous with “woman-hunts” [^24] she is famously quoted of having said it. What she does conclude is how the trials were the first criminalization act[^15] against women, changing the role from pure, innocent, and caring to potentially dangerous. The ones most likely to be accused were the “independent-minded (and -mouthed) women” who provoked “male hatred of the female body into a real, believable factor in the craze” [^ 18]. With the change in how the female body is viewed in society this is also the time when religion seeps into political ideology to the point where laws were more blatantly based off religious ideas. To be a witch meant to go against the church, to deny the church meant you denied the governing bodies right to the throne, which in turn was treason [^16]. Not every person who considered the importance of the female body took this encompassing of an approach.

E. William Monter was sympathetic towards women witches seeing their magic as a way to make up for their legal and economic disadvantages. As many women were accused by other women this became a sort of empowering move for women to find a place in legal affairs. He was also increasingly more interested in the single woman trope. The different facets of young to old and how a single woman falling into one of those age ranges had a different level of economic power [^19].

Linda Hult used images by the artist Hans Baldung, such as the ones above, to understand how women were portrayed in art during the hunts. Art is a different form of documentation that is so telling of what caught audiences eyes during situations such as this one. She realized that the women were usually depicted as overly sexualized in orgy like rituals that departed from the norm of women while illustrating demonic and fearful images. Witches were powerless and feared, yet depicted as “perennially lusting yet never satisfied”. These painted creatures sought freedom and power but because of how audiences viewed their heresy they were the most enslaved of all [^20].

Each historian did not inherently look for why women were prosecuted but each understand a trend and questioned the culture behind it. Each historian took aspects outside of history to apply it to the general assumptions made by those who came before. Building grounds and creating debates on whether gender should be included in the study of witches.



# A Gendered Argument?

Many women were accused and executed due to the witch hunts, but almost no historian has deduced that this was due to the misogynistic tendencies of society. Scholars such as Elsphat Whitney, Kirsten C. Uszkalo, and Anne Llewellyn Barstow, all of whom have been credited in this essay, belief that the study of witches needs to begin to *question the relationship of gender, and accusations**. So many historians, females included, have either ignored this fact or recognized it but did not see a causality within the gendered argument. Even women who study this do not see a correlation in the argument. Is there something within the documents kept that will not allow the conclusion of a “women hunt” or is there really no proof beyond merely noticing that women were chosen more frequently than men?
