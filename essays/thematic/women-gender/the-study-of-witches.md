# Introduction
Witches in a modern society are seen as unreasonable and illogical. To accuse someone of heresy in the modern time would turn heads but mostly out of concern for your mental health. Yet they are still constant concepts in fantasy shows, movies, books, and other genres of entertainment. The stereotypes that have been developing over time have shaped what women should not be like in order to stay apart of society. Though they have now grown into symbols of feminism and women strength with each new wave of feminism.

These stereotypes and growth are not only seen in entertainment but in how their histories have been studied since the early nineteenth century. The fears and judgements that rang true in the 1500s and 1600s have not gone away but have built the current stereotypes and as historians gained more interest into identity work the stereotypes have changed.


In school in the United States, many of the exposure to witch trials comes from a brief overview of the [Salem Witch Trials](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/a-brief-history-of-the-salem-witch-trials-175162489/) in both history and occasionally english classes by reading _The Crucible_. These brief overviews glance over the massive impact the trials had on economics and women’s place in society. They introduce a difficult topic leaving most people's knowledge about the witch trials to be

While this idea is not totally inaccurate it **leaves out the years of work historians have been developing over time about the trials in Europe and Russia**. For the purpose of simplicity this essay will _focus less on Russia and more on the European front as the two don’t follow the same patterns_. 
# Important Texts and Early Writers
In order to study the trials, and any history really, people needed to search for [primary documents](https://umb.libguides.com/PrimarySources/secondary). These documents range from witch hunting guides to the trial records themselves. Depending on the geographical region, some had more documents than others.

Germany had over 30,000 accounts  of witch trials[^1] and executions during the long standing witch craze from 1500-1775. The Third Reich, with their heavy interest in all things science fiction to reality, did extensive research on witches to understand their potential benefit to their regime. They set up [Hexen Sonderkommando](https://www.pravdareport.com/society/123470-third_reich_witches/) which specializes in all things witches. From the trials to the executions to the general philosophical idea of what made a witch these sonderkommando was in charge of it. Of course, in true third reich fashion they maintained their focus on Germany and the preservation of its history.

Another very influential text to come from Germany was found much earlier than the rise of the Third Reich. [ The Malleus Maleficarum](https://www.thoughtco.com/malleus-maleficarum-witch-document-3530785) was the german witch hunters guide. This document was written in _**1486 and 1487** by two German Dominican monks, Heinrich Kramer and Jacob Sprenger_. Given this document was written after the Gutenberg Printing Press, it had an advantage over documents of a similar message. This also helped preserve the document in time as so many people believed in it and carried it through the times with them even after there were no more legal witch trials. Joseph Hansen, a german born historian, published the first major work on witch historiography utilizing the role the Malleus Maleficarum had on a society over run with fears against witchcraft. His book _**Zauberwahn, Inquisition und Hexenprozess im Mittelalter und die Entstehung der grossen Hexenverfolgung** (Magical Illusion, Inquisition, and Witch Trials in the Middle Ages, and the Formation of the Larger Persecution of Witches)_ was published in 1900 followed by his sourcebook in 1901, _Quellen und Untersuchungen zur Geschichte des Hexenwahns und der Hexenverfolgung im Mittelalter: Mit einer Untersuchung der Geschichte des Wortes Hexe_. His book **“identifies the accumulated beliefs of sorcery and heresy as comprising witchcraft in its fifteenth-century concept”**[^1]

In England, King James I of England, or VI of Scotland, wrote _**Daemonologie, In Forme of a Dialogue, Divided into three Books: By the High and Mighty Prince, Jame by the Grace of God King of England, Scotland, France,  and Ireland**_ . His purpose for writing this was to _” serue for a shew of my learning & ingine”_ [^2], an understanding and warning of/for witches. In his three books he structures his argument as describing magic, describing sorcery and witchcraft, and finishing with a description of spirits and specters [^3] The importance of this text is that it inspired many others to write on who were susceptible to the devils lure. This also influenced how people under King James I’s rule would hold trials and the proceedings by which they were accused. In history, by studying this document before studying the trials there is a sense of culture and a deeper look into the minds of the people during the witch craze.

# Postmodernism's Influence

Although the first major works about witches were published in 1900, falling within the modern period of historiography, witch historiography was greatly impacted by the postmodern movement. Many historians interested in witches who came out of this period incorporated methods beyond history. In order to understand this psychological phenomenon many needed to understand psychology in general. Witch  historiography began to consider and incorporate topics such as **”history, anthropology, magic, popular superstitions, religion, theology, law, psychology, sexuality, gender, sociology, medicine, politics, loanguage, popular beliefs, folklore studies, and popular culture:** [^1] Aligning with the change from macro-history to micro-story during this time. Going from grand views of witches blending into society and plucking them out individually to see the “political, social, and economic context” [^4].
