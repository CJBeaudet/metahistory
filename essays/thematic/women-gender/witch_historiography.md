## Why Witches?

In this essay, I will be looking into the **study of witches** _starting at the turn of the 20th century to the present_. I will be looking at specific historians and the viewpoints most groups took while approaching the subject of the trials. As well I am limiting myself to **Northern European and US historians** who _look at sources from the 16th and 17th centuries_ as a way to understand a specific set of mindsets towards witches. As most of our history falls into a western frame, I believed it would be easiest to understand the difference in the economic and gendered viewpoints of witch historiography in the regions of France, England, Germany, Spain, the US, and some surrounding regions as they arise within this framework.

# Introduction

Witches have been a mainstream halloween costume depicting anything from an old hag to a young and promiscuous women.  These stereotypes are not separated in an academic setting, rather further defined and reasoned with. Raising questions among historians and other philosophers as to why witches are important to a society in the first place? The witch craze of the 16th and 17th centuries stigmatized being unmarried, a sole heirace, an old Hag, essentially any women who could feel powerful for any reason. There are other aspects of society that are affected by the mass amount of executions and trails and general accustasations. These aspects are what historians seek to understand and give further reason towards. The Salem witch trials were just one of many places heavily corrupted by the ease of accusing a woman of tempering with livestock, human life, and other forms of wealth and virtue. The trials that took place in England and Germany were horrific in the amount of women who died merely because someone had a grudge or reason for executing their neighbor. 

The sources acquired are riddled with inherent biases on women and their place in society, serving less of a purpose in a gendered study than in a more economic study. As general historiography begins to shift from a rigid economic viewpoint to a more individualistic viewpoint so does the narrative of the witch.

# The Study of Witches
People who studied witches were interested in understanding the economic impact the trials had on the overall community. Recognizing that most were women and the rest were associated with an already accused witch, this information rarely goes past mere recognition. Joseph Hansen was one of the first major researchers on witchcraft, publishing his work at the turn of the century. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Hansen_(historian))(on studying witchcraft, pg. 9) As a german historian, his expanse of resources was not limited only by that of his innate male bias. Yet as a leading figure he does start off the research on a note that would allow for future historians to look into the gendered argument of why were witches predominantly women. For many decades historians focused on the classist or economic argument as to why someone was accused of being a witch. Being described by Gustav Henningsen as: 
> “first, the weakest members of the community, including beggars, cripples, widows, the very old and orphans, and second, ‘those who had rejected the moral order of society: fawning, envious, thieving, aggressive, spiteful, promiscuous and odd people; in fact, all who were in any way unattractive,’” (“she/”he” 79)

Not using directly femine pronouns or language to assert the bias of the trials in his description, Heningsen looked at a more religious and economical standpoint. 
# The Historians of Witches
The study of witchcraft was heavily influenced by the postmodern movement. Although the first histrorains to interpret this data came in the late 19th century, many ground breaking work that is used as a base for further research comes from the historians of the 1970's and 1980's. 
The first witch historians being Joseph Hansen and Wallace Notestein, both acknowledge the fact that predominently women are tried and acused of being witches (On studying Witchcraft). THey are modern historians influenced by the academic norm established by **insert modern historian here, Ranke?, Marx? Will figure out later**

- Christina Larner: Scottish witchcraft historian and a professor of Sociology at The University of Glasgow. She is credited with calling the “witch-hunts” “women hunts” in her research but not fully concluding the actual role of gender in the overall hunts. Her three books are _A Sourebok of Scottish Witchcraft (1977)_ , _Enemies of God (1981)_ , and _Witchcraft and Religion (1984)_. The influence the post modern idea of thought is exemplified in Larner’s work. She is an early female historian who dedicated her historical work to a sociological phenomenon, the witch hunts. Her findings followed the many trends of economics but was always aware of the potential impact being a women would have had on the people in her chosen timelines. As women 


The main method used in the historiography of witches is from the postmodern perspective. The idea that the _“witch hunts”_ were actually _“women hunts”_ (Christina Larner) giving this seeming **economic study a more gendered face is still not fully recognized but debated and questioned**. Joseph Hansen, one of the first witch historians from Germany, published his book **_Zauberwahn, Inquisition und Hexenprozess im Mittelalter und die Entstehung der grossen Hexenverfolgung_** _(Magical Illusion, Inquisition, and Witch Trials in the Middle Ages, and the Formation of the Larger Persecution of Witches)_ in 1900, mentioning but not focusing on the fact that mainly women were persecuted. Many historians who looked at the hunts later mostly looked at the economic and socio economic value in the hunts as this is what the modernist historians did. Trial records, execution records, and other quantitative records were used to understand how the trials were used as an economic.

Historians such as Keith Thomas, Alan Macfarlane, and Gustav Henningsen looked at the folklore believes in society that led to the witch hunts. The dynamic between the _“male-dominated official culture and a female-dominated family and folk culture”_ (International Trends) were not their focus when using more official based documents to extract folklore representations. Henningsen also describes accused witches as either the **“weakest members of the community, including beggars, cripples, widows, the very old and orphans”** or **“those who had rejected the moral order of society: fawning, envious, thieving, aggressive, spiteful, promiscuous and odd people,”**
