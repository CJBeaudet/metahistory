## Why Witches?
Over time witch hunts have been used to assimilate many social movements. This psycological phenomenon has provided understanding of how humans could use the judicial and overall governmental system for their own personal revenge. They also provide a deeper understanding into how religiously cetnered each country was. Those based less in intellect and more in faith saw more growth in the affects of the witch craze providing specific documents for later scholars to understand how each society was based.

The questions I would like to answer are _why witches? how did their language and idealization change overtime? and why are they important to a current society?_ In american schools we cover the Salem witch trials glossing over other countries own witch hunts and the affect that the European front had on the world at large.

# The Study of Witches
People who studied witches were interested in understanding the economic impact the trials had on the overall community. Recognizing that most were women and the rest were associated with an already accused witch, this information rarely goes past mere recognition. Joseph Hansen was one of the first major researchers on witchcraft, publishing his work at the turn of the century. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Hansen_(historian))(on studying witchcraft, pg. 9) As a german historian, his expanse of resources was not limited only by that of his innate male bias. Yet as a leading figure he does start off the research on a note that would allow for future historians to look into the gendered argument of why were witches predominantly women. For many decades historians focused on the classist or economic argument as to why someone was accused of being a witch. Being described by Gustav Henningsen as: 
> “first, the weakest members of the community, including beggars, cripples, widows, the very old and orphans, and second, ‘those who had rejected the moral order of society: fawning, envious, thieving, aggressive, spiteful, promiscuous and odd people; in fact, all who were in any way unattractive,’” (“she/”he” 79)

Not using directly femine pronouns or language to assert the bias of the trials in his description, Heningsen looked at a more religious and economical standpoint.
