## Why Witches?

In this essay, I will be looking into the **study of witches** _starting at the turn of the 20th century to the present_. I will be looking at specific historians and the viewpoints most groups took while approaching the subject of the trials. As well I am limiting myself to **Northern European and US historians** who _look at sources from the 16th and 17th centuries_ as a way to understand a specific set of mindsets towards witches. As most of our history falls into a western frame, I believed it would be easiest to understand the difference in the economic and gendered viewpoints of witch historiography in the regions of France, England, Germany, Spain, the US, and some surrounding regions as they arise within this framework.

# Introduction

Witches have been a mainstream halloween costume depicting anything from an old hag to a young and promiscuous women.  These stereotypes are not separated in an academic setting, rather further defined and reasoned with. Raising questions among historians and other philosophers as to why witches are important to a society in the first place? The witch craze of the 16th and 17th centuries stigmatized being unmarried, a sole heirace, an old Hag, essentially any women who could feel powerful for any reason. There are other aspects of society that are affected by the mass amount of executions and trails and general accustasations. These aspects are what historians seek to understand and give further reason towards. The Salem witch trials were just one of many places heavily corrupted by the ease of accusing a woman of tempering with livestock, human life, and other forms of wealth and virtue. The trials that took place in England and Germany were horrific in the amount of women who died merely because someone had a grudge or reason for executing their neighbor. 

The sources acquired are riddled with inherent biases on women and their place in society, serving less of a purpose in a gendered study than in a more economic study. As general historiography begins to shift from a rigid economic viewpoint to a more individualistic viewpoint so does the narrative of the witch.

# The Study of Witches
People who studied witches were interested in understanding the economic impact the trials had on the overall community. Recognizing that most were women and the rest were associated with an already accused witch, this information rarely goes past mere recognition. Joseph Hansen was one of the first major researchers on witchcraft, publishing his work at the turn of the century. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Hansen_(historian))(on studying witchcraft, pg. 9) As a german historian, his expanse of resources was not limited only by that of his innate male bias. Yet as a leading figure he does start off the research on a note that would allow for future historians to look into the gendered argument of why were witches predominantly women. For many decades historians focused on the classist or economic argument as to why someone was accused of being a witch. Being described by Gustav Henningsen as: 
> “first, the weakest members of the community, including beggars, cripples, widows, the very old and orphans, and second, ‘those who had rejected the moral order of society: fawning, envious, thieving, aggressive, spiteful, promiscuous and odd people; in fact, all who were in any way unattractive,’” (“she/”he” 79)

Not using directly femine pronouns or language to assert the bias of the trials in his description, Heningsen looked at a more religious and economical standpoint.
