  # Mental Disorders
**Abstract**
I am a history major, and a psychology minor here at UNM. That being said, I plan to combine the two disciplines in the charting of mental disorders as they have been medically perceived, and historically recorded throughout time. The first historical record of mental disorders dates back to 400 B.C., and continues to be researched in the present. This essay will provide a concise history of mental disorders that incorporates perceived causalities, as well as the treatments, as both progress through documented history. Being that I cannot possibly include every recorded episode, I will provide the majorly influential examples that were, and are, widely accepted. The academic value within these works are intended to summarize and educate the readers on mental disorders throughout the majority of documented history, and why it is important that these areas continue to be researched.

The documented history of mental disorders dates back over the last “10,000 years, with the timeline holding evident through evidence of *Trephination* throughout Europe” (4). With more than “200 skulls being found from Scandinavia to the Balkans” (4). This ancient technique was the first surgical operation and served numerous purposes. It’s evolution through the periods advanced the technical means, knowledge, and therapeutic needs as time elapsed. “Hippocrates was the one to classify for the first time the kinds of cranial fractures and define the conditions and circumstances for carrying out trepanning” (4). “In 400 B.C. **Hippocrates** suggested that mental disorders are caused by both biological and psychological attributes” (1). Hippocrates, also known as Hippocrates II, was a Greek physician, who is considered one of the most outstanding figures in the history of medicine, as well as “the father of western medicine” (1). It is evident that during this place in time mental disorders were thought to be cured by the drilling of holes, through specific parts of the skull, allowing the pressure to be released along with any bad spirits. 

In 200 A.D. **Galen**, a Roman physician adopted and incorporating Hippocrates ideas which created a long lasting school of thought throughout the field of psychopathology. He suggested that normal and abnormal behaviors are related to four bodily fluids, or humors. These fluids/humors needed to be maintained at specific levels in order for people to function ‘normally’. This biological tradition would continue into the 19th century. However, during the “18th and 19th century, trephination operations had been rejected as a therapeutic surgical method, due to the high mortality that reached 100% at the time” (4).

The documented history of mental disorders seems to have taken about a nine-hundred year hiatus, as the timeline did not pick up again until the 1300’s.  Mental disorders in this period are blamed on demons and witches. **Superstition** was widespread, with exorcisms being performed to rid victims of ‘evil spirits’. In the “late Middle Ages mental illness was not recognized as such. Instead, the mentally disturbed were accused of witchcraft” (5). In the late 14th century religious powers that be began supporting these superstitions due to their rising popularity amongst European society. 
Witches and demons were thought to have possessed those who’s bizarre behaviors exhibited by those who were mentally ill, were actually viewed as the work of the devil. The treatments for these *mental disorders* leaned on religion alone to cure the individuals. With “exorcism, in various religious rituals were performed in an effort to rid the victim of evil spirits. Shaving the pattern of the cross in the hair on the victims head, and securing sufferers to a wall near the front of the church so that they might benefit from hearing Mass” (1). These superstitions carried their way through the next few centuries. As the causality of evil and madness were blamed on witchcraft and sorcery in the 15th century. This ‘causality’ even spilled its way across the Atlantic, as “evident by the Salem, Massachusetts witch trials in the late 17th century which resulted in the hanging deaths of numerous women” (1). Due to the fact that most accused of having these powers and or possessions would openly admit to “having carried out impossible acts such as flying through the air, they were deluded, and probably many were schizophrenic” (5). 

The treatment for possession that was unrelated to religion was even stranger, especially at first glance. One treatment was to “suspend the possessed person over a pit full of poisonous snakes so that it might scare the evil spirits right out of their bodies” (1). Oddly enough, sometimes this tactic/treatment actually took effect. “Strange behaving individuals would suddenly come to their senses and experience relief from their symptoms, even if only temporarily” (1). Other treatments methods consisted of  “dunking the person(s) in ice-cold water” as an element of shock (1). In the 1500’s **Paracelsus**, a Swiss physician and astrologer, was a pioneer in several aspects of the medical revolution of the Renaissance. He proposes that it is not the devil or evil spirits that affect people’s psychological functioning, but instead, the moon and the stars. From 1400-1800 those thought to have mental disorders were also treated by **bloodletting** and leaches to rid the body of unhealthy fluids and restore the chemical balance. 

The biological school of thought continued to “wax and wane during the times of Hippocrates and Galen but was reinvigorated in the 19th century because of two factors” (1). One, the discovery and causation of *syphilis*, and two, strong support from the most influential American psychiatrist at the time, **John P. Grey**. He is considered “the champion of the biological tradition in the United States” (1). **John P. Grey** was the head of New York’s Utica Hospital. He believed that insanity was caused by physical attributes, which de-emphasized the psychological treatments. The fields of psychopathology, psychology, and psychiatry were now heading in a scientific direction, whereas before, they had been seen as spiritual in both causality, and treatment. This giving way to moral therapy.

In 1793 **Philippe Pinel**, a French physician who was highly influential in the development of a more humane psychological approach to the care and safekeeping of psychiatric patients, which is more commonly known in the present as moral therapy. He introduces **moral therapy** and implicates more humane practices in French mental institutions. “In the 19th century mental disorders were attributed to mental or emotional stress, so patients were often treated sympathetically in a restful and hygienic environment” (1). This new approach was quite the dichotomy from the previous practices.
 In 1848 **Dorothea Dix**, as an American advocate for the mentally ill who fought through lobbying state legislatures and the United States Congress, helped to create the first generation of American mental asylums which successfully campaigns for humane treatment in U.S. mental institutions. This far in the history of mental disorders, documentation has conveyed the ways in which these issues are perceived and dealt with. Another aspect of this time period that is important to the applicable fields is **Emil Kraepelin**, “one of the founding fathers of modern psychiatry publishes work on diagnosis, classifying numerous psychological disorders from a biological perspective. Prior to this, diagnosis, classification, and stratification had not yet been incorporated. 
 
Across the globe, numerous individuals began to develop hypothesis, theories, and new branches of the field of mental disorders. In 1900 **Sigmund Freud**, an Austrian neurologist and the founder of psychoanalysis, which was a clinical method for treating psychopathology through dialogue between a patient and a psychoanalyst published ‘The Interpretation of Dreams’. While in 1904 **Ivan Pavlov**, a Russian physiologist known primarily for his work in classical conditioning, received the Nobel Prize due to his studies on the physiology of digestion. In the viewpoint of behavioral psychologists, those who suffered from certain mental disorders could be treated with Pavlov’s classical conditioning. 
Behaviorism would be coined by John B. Watson, an American psychologist who established the psychological school of behaviorism. He indorsed a change in psychology through his speech about the Psychology as the Behaviorist Views it, which he gave at Columbia University in 1913. In 1920 **John B. Watson’s** ‘Little Albert’ experiments dealing with conditioned fear, through the use of operant conditioning. This was the term coined later by **B.F. Skinner** in 1938. He elaborates the principals of operant conditioning through his publishing of The Behavior of Organisms. Which by *reinforcement* and *shaping* were used in order to ‘correct’ the behavior of an individual.

Going slightly back in time to 1930, **electric shock treatments** as well as **brain surgery** began to be used to treat psychopathology. Other than *psychosurgery* such as *trephination*, **ECT** is the most controversial treatment for mental disorders. The ideas for this go back even further, but so as to not have disrupted the continuity of *Behaviorism* I jumped around in my chronology. Benjamin Franklin “accidentally discovered, and then confirmed experimentally in the 1750’s, that a mild electric shock produced a brief convulsion and memory loss, but otherwise did little harm. Soon then after, a friend of Franklin, a Dutch physician proposed that this shock may serve as a treatment for depression. 

In the 1950’s mental hospitals began to incorporate the practice of *electric shock therapy*, however, they used it more as a tool for “obedience and abuse” than a cure for mental disorders (1). In present day practices of *ECT* electroconvulsive therapy patients are “anesthetized an to reduce discomfort and given muscle-relaxing drugs to prevent bone breaking from the convulsions during the seizures” (1). The way in which these seizures are said to help those who suffer from depression is as follows. “ECT increases levels of serotonin, blocks stress hormones, and promotes neurogenesis in the hippocampus” (1). Basically, it gives the individual more happy/feel-good chemicals/neurotransmitters, blocks the negative chemicals, and regrows/revitalizes parts of our brain that deal with emotion, it just took two and a half centuries to get it right.
