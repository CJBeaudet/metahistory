  # Mental Disorders
  **Abstract**:
I am a history major, and a psychology minor here at UNM. That being said, I plan to combine the two disciplines in the charting of mental disorders as they have been medically perceived, and historically recorded throughout history. The first historical record of mental disorders dates back to 400 B.C., and continues to be researched in the present. This essay will provide a concise history of mental disorders that incorporates perceived causalities, as well as the treatments as both progress through documented history. Being that I cannot possibly include every recorded episode, I will provide the majorly influential examples that were, and are, widely accepted. The academic value within these works are intended to summarize and educate the readers on mental disorders throughout the majority of documented history, and why it is important that these areas continue to be researched.
