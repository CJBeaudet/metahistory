#### Abstract

I am going to take you on an adventure through time where you and I will look at the concept itself. In historical practice, there are different perceptions of time at work. Things like religion or politics have influenced these different perceptions. Perceptions of time shape how history was written and studied, but you would not know it since, in historical practice today, there is an all-consuming linear view of history when that is not the only type of hisotry. There is also cyclical and unilinear. There is also the path inwhihc hisotry would follow wether that is an decline or incline. Then there is the topic of the past, present, and futre and how different civlizations percieved each one how the value they put into those terms. 

### History

There are multiple perceptions of time throughout different cultures in history. Beginning in ancient times, the significant empires throughout the period had a mostly cyclical view of history influenced by different aspects of culture and everyday life. The Nile river influenced the Egyptian perceptions of history. Their cyclical view revolving around natural cycles like that of seasons time was therefore determined or perceived as, according to G.J. Whitrow in *Time in History*, "a succession of reoccurring phases" (Whitrow 25). In the Persian era,__ Zoroastrianism__ emerged. Zoroastrianism was the first religion to be monotheistic. Monotheism, as we will see later on, plays a big role in a culture or society's perception of time. In the case of the Zoroastrian religion, time was the creator; it was the supreme being. Time, however, was dualistic, there being two perceptions of time that were simultaneous with one another. The First being Zurvan akaran( infinite time) "progenitor of the universe and of the spirits of good and evil." (Whitrow 35). The second is Zurvan daregho- chvadhata (finite time) that brings death and decay this time can be understood as the time that humans follow while Infinite time is the time of the Gods. One is not without the other, "finite-time came into existence out of infinite time. It goes through a cycle of changes until it finally returns to its original state" (Whitrow 35).

According to Arnaldo Momigliano in Time in Ancient Historiography, Thucydides is whom we should attribute the cyclical view of history "(Momigliano 11). __Thucydides__ (460-400) was a Greek historian who wrote about the Peloponnesian war. Thucydides was under the belief that "there will be future events either identical or similar" to the ones he narrated (Momigliano 11). Nemesius, Bishop of Emesa, was under the belief that people would live the same life with the same friends. Stating the both Socrates and Plato would be once again (Whitrow 43). It is important to realize that not every Greek intellectual was under the belief that history was cyclical. Some believed that only politics or changing of political climate was cyclical, not history as a whole. Grace Cairns in *Philosophies of Histories* states that Toynbee beleived that 
>“there are cyclical patterns he admits in the rise and fall of great civilizations; nevertheless there has been linear progress on the whole in religion“(279).

The __Roman empire__ was one that believed they were timeless, believing that their empire was the peak of perfection. This changed with __Constantine__, making Christianity the main religion of the Roman empire. With there was a shift from cyclical history to linear history as Christianity took over. 

### Decline and Incline

The Greeks, Romans, and Egyptians were all under the belief that time began with a Golden age. The __Golden age__ was when God or Gods and man were close to one another. Until a time where something happened and disrupted the relationship between the two, and they were separated. In this form or perception of time, humans are on a __decline__ have started from the bottom but falling into a more primitive state of mind and society.

In a different perception of time, humans at the beginning were primitive beast but are on the incline as they acquire more knowledge through time. This can be seen especially in that of Judaism and Christianity. While man did start in a type of Golden Age in the Garden of Eden, humans since the fall are working their ways towards salvation. A famous advocate of linear history was St. Augustine. __St. Augustine__ (354-430) was a Christian thinker who wrote many famous works one of them being the *City of God*. In his writings, "he rejected the idea of cosmic and historical cycles endlessly recurring" (Lemon 91). 
Cyclical history requires a dualism or polytheistic view or heavy importance on politics. While linear history is focused on the one, God one path for "faith expressed itself, according to Eliade, in a linear view of history" (Olsen 17) . While it was unintentional linear history is what became the way in which to write history.  To put it in more perspective Whitrow states that
> "Whereas for most Greeks and Romans, whether they believed in cycles or not, the dominant aspects of time were the present and the past, Christianity directed man's attention to the future. Pg. 64-65).

Time tells us a lot about a culture and or civilization. Looking at polytheistic groups like that of the Egyptians, we can descreen they had a more cyclical view of time. Those who were monotheistic, therefore, had a linear view of time. Understanding what time says about a culture or society is important to histography. It can be used as a method to uncover some biased or inclination of one's view of themselves in time. Cycles may work for one type of history like that of political or economic while it may not work with things like religion, Cairns, puts this into perspective saying "there are cyclical patterns he admits in the rise and fall of great civilizations; nevertheless there has been linear progress on the whole in religion "(Cairns 279). 

### Time of the Scholar vs. Time of the Ordinary Man  

Historically, the overall written account of history has come from the upper class like that of philosophers, scholars, and from institutions like that of the church. For the majority of academic scholarship, history has been written by very few. This is important, especially when it comes to perceptions of time and historical progress. For academic scholarship, time is linear because of non-repeating events in the overall historical narrative. For the ordinary man, however, he may feel that it is cyclical because of the life that he or she live People who worked the lands were often under a cyclical view of time. Momigliano gives us a good perspective when talking about Plato; he states, " __there is no reason to consider Plato's thoughts about time as typical of the ordinary Greek man"__ (8). When studying history, it is for this reason that we need to be aware of the different types of time that people are writing history. While some are writing under the impression that there is a repetition, others are writing under the impression that there is not. Another immpressiong that time can have is when it comes to the past, present, and furture.

### Past, Present, Furture

The Greeks, Romans, and Jews put different emphasis on the the past, present, and future. The Greeks concern lied more in the past becase of the lack of hisotrical account that Greek hisotrians had. The Greesk were ina sort of race againt time as hisotrical evidence and sources disappeard due to decay. In *Essay in Ancient and Modern Historiography* Arnoldo Momigliano staes that "there was more concern with the future among Roman historians, and it expressed   itself in anxiety about the Roman empire." (Essay in Historiography 193. The furture of the empire was the main focus of Roman intellectuals. The __eternal Rome__ and the stae of politics influenced the emphaisi and study or reason why they wrote history. The objective of writing history was to determine the future. For the Jews time was about the present and the future. God was in the present but he was also in the future when it was time for salvation. In modern historirgaphical study the past present furture is no so clear cut since history is of the past. 




### Cyclical and Linear? Are they still in style

Today the linear view of history is taught in school. There is an overall incline view of the direction in which history is moving, not one of dissension. Teaching the linear path of history implies that there will be an eventual incline or decline of historical progress; therefore, this may or may not be create a biased. The Roman empire had a cyclical path of time. This greatly influenced their opinion of themselves and their empire, giving them a sort of evidence that they were at the peak of perfection the __Rome eternal__.

“In ordinary oral or written communication, the reference either to past or to the future can be left to the understanding or imagination of the recipient” (Momigliano 6).  







 


Everything i have written does not matter because in ther end time is subjective. 

### Questions
How to we reconcile multiple perceptions of time when writing about hisotry? 

For a histiography should one look past conceptions of time or it an integral part of a culutres history? 

For those under the immpression that history is cyccal what is the point of wrting hisory if they believe that it is repeating?
