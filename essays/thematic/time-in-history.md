### Abstract

I am going to take you on an adventure through time where you and I will look at the concept itself. In historical practice, there are different perceptions of time at work. Things like religion or politics have influenced these different perceptions. Perceptions of time shape how history was written and studied, but you would not know it since, in historical practice today, there is an all-consuming linear view of history when that is not the only type of hisotry. There is also cyclical and unilinear. For the purpose of this paper, however, we will be focusing on linear and cyclical views of historical progress and why it is important in historiography.  

### History

There are multiple perceptions of time throughout different cultures in history. Beginning in ancient times, the significant empires throughout the period had a mostly cyclical view of history influenced by different aspects of culture and everyday life. The Nile river influenced the Egyptian perceptions of history. Their cyclical view revolving around natural cycles like that of seasons time was therefore determined or perceived as "a succession of reoccurring phases" (Whitrow 25). In the Persian era,__ Zoroastrianism__ emerged. Zoroastrianism was the first religion to be monotheistic. Monotheism, as we will see later on, plays a big role in a culture or society's perception of time. In the case of the Zoroastrian religion, time was the creator; it was the supreme being. Time, however, was dualistic, there being two perceptions of time that were simultaneous with one another. The First being Zurvan akaran( infinite time) "progenitor of the universe and of the spirits of good and evil." (Whitrow 35). The second is Zurvan daregho- chvadhata (finite time) that brings death and decay this time can be understood as the time that humans follow while Infinite time is the time of the Gods. One is not without the other, "finite-time came into existence out of infinite time. It goes through a cycle of changes until it finally returns to its original state" (Whitrow 35).

According to Arnaldo Momigliano, Thucydides is whom we should attribute the cyclical view of history "(Momigliano 11). __Thucydides__ (460-400) was a Greek historian who wrote about the Peloponnesian war. Thucydides was under the belief that "there will be future events either identical or similar" to the ones he narrated (Momigliano 11). Nemesius, Bishop of Emesa, was under the belief that people would live the same life with the same friends. Stating the both Socrates and Plato would be once again (Whitrow 43). It is important to realize that not every Greek intellectual was under the belief that history was cyclical. Some believed that only politics or changing of political climate was cyclical, not history as a whole. The __Roman empire__ was one that believed they were timeless, believing that their empire was the peak of perfection. This changed with __Constantine__, making Christianity the main religion of the Roman empire. With there was a shift from cyclical history to linear history as Christianity took over. 

### Decline and Incline

The Greeks, Romans, and Egyptians were all under the belief that time began with a Golden age. The __Golden age__ was when God or Gods and man were close to one another. Until a time where something happened and disrupted the relationship between the two, and they were separated. In this form or perception of time, humans are on a __decline__ have started from the bottom but falling into a more primitive state of mind and society.

In a different perception of time, humans at the beginning were primitive beast but are on the incline as they acquire more knowledge through time. This can be seen especially in that of Judaism and Christianity. While man did start in a type of Golden Age in the Garden of Eden, humans since the fall are working their ways towards salvation. A famous advocate of linear history was St. Augustine. __St. Augustine__ (354-430) was a Christian thinker who wrote many famous works one of them being the *City of God*. In his writings, "he rejected the idea of cosmic and historical cycles endlessly recurring" (Lemon 91). 
Cyclical history requires a dualism or polytheistic view or heavy importance on politics. While linear history is focused on the one, God one path for "faith expressed itself, according to Eliade, in a linear view of history" (Olsen 17) . While it was unintentional linear history is what became the way in which to write history.  

Time tells us a lot about a culture and or civilization. Looking at polytheistic groups like that of the Egyptians, we can descreen they had a more cyclical view of time. Those who were monotheistic, therefore, had a linear view of time. Understanding what time says about a culture or society is important to histography. It can be used as a method to uncover some biased or inclination of one's view of themselves in time. Cycles may work for one type of history like that of political or economic while it may not work with things like religion, Cairns, puts this into perspective saying "there are cyclical patterns he admits in the rise and fall of great civilizations; nevertheless there has been linear progress on the whole in religion "(Cairns 279). 








 


Everything i have written does not matter because in ther end time is subjective. 

### Questions
How to we reconcile multiple perceptions of time when writing about hisotry? 

For a histiography should one look past conceptions of time or it an integral part of a culutres history?
