When we think about history we often think of folklore, and the stories that are told are often ways people share their traditions and histories. In the past oral history has only been spoken and never really recorded until the technology developed. Today, Oral History has been made into new mediums for all people to have knowledge and access to, like the "*Ted Bundy Tapes*" on Netflix. Netflix has turned these tapes that only certain people had access to because of the technology they had available during the 70's and 80's. Today those tapes have been made into a documentary where people like us can listen to what the infamous serial killer, Ted Bundy, had to say. When we listened to these tapes and heard what Ted Bundy had to say we didn’t question if Bundy was lying or telling the truth in those interviews, but what we did know is that we were hearing Bundy tell his story the way he wanted to tell it. Are there problems with this and the fact we only heard his story the way he wanted us to remember it?

For centuries philosophers and historians have argued why oral history is not a good way to record history because the way people often tell the history of the past. It gets construed because of the way they remember the event. The ancient Greek historian Thucydides states this as well when he writes his famous book called * The History of the Peloponnesian Wars *. He says, “My conclusions have cost me some labour from the want of coincidence between accounts of the same occurrences by different eyewitnesses, arising sometimes from imperfect memory, sometimes from undue partiality for one side or the other” (Thucydides, 40-41). Thucydides talks about how people remember the same event differently, and often, as the people talk about the event that happened gets twisted and information gets changed. Historians have often disregarded oral history because it can be unreliable for many reasons. Any interview could be bias. The interviewee could be made uncomfortable because of the environment they are in. In the 1930’s, a giant machine called a reel to reel, was needed to interview someone. Imagine how loud that machine was and how that would make the interviewee feel uncomfortable or even intimidated.They have also argued against the use of oral history because written history started to become more popular. With the rise of written sources oral history is often misunderstood and deemed less valuable as documents. In earlier debates historians and philosophers argued weather oral history could be used as valid sources for studying history. In an essay written by Nicholas Mariner he writes about the bias interviews have and refers back to another historian.  He says: 

>“The issue of oral history is not the ‘stuff’ that comes out of the interviews, but how the interview is the inherent problem of the process from the beginning. ‘Taking notes on an interview,’ according to Tuchman, ‘is a crystallizing process…distinguishing the significant from the insignificant as you go along.’ The problem with the interview then is the interviewer’s tendency to not write down specifically what is said because the interview (recorder) does not see the significance of what the narrator (speaker) is saying.  Such conscious omission affects the historical process in such a way that it questions the legitimacy of the endeavor at its very base.  Not only can the interview omit what is not important as he/she sees it, but the interviewer also has the ability to create, from the narrator, a significance that was not intended.  Tuchman states that the interview ‘has the power to create, with words, an image that was once not there in the mind of the reader.’ That is to say, the interviewer, with sole access to the interviews transcription, can pick and chose the spoken word to fit an argument that may not have been the narrator’s intended purpose for such comments” (Mariner,61).

What Mariner says is that the notes taken during an interview can be wrong based on the fact we, as interviewers, get to pick and choose what we think is insignificant, and what we may think as insignificant may not be insignificant to the person we are interviewing, and that makes the interview unreliable. The questions the interviewer asks could be worded in a way that makes the interviewee answer in swayed direction, and that makes the interview as a whole unreliable. Though, not only the interviewer could be bias, but the interviewee could be answering in ways that serve an alternative purpose as well. There is also the case of misremembrance. People telling their history will often forget or add to it making the whole truth unknown.

In recent years, the attitudes toward oral history has changed because of the development in technology, and this allowed us to develop new forms of oral history with the digital age, such as podcasts and music.  Music has always been a form of oral history, but wasn’t taken seriously by historians of the past because it was viewed as storytelling and often the music was changed for the reasons we have mentioned above, and not a reliable source to use, but now we have more advanced technology to hear the music written by people that are telling their own story, for example the rapper Tupac creates music about how he views his home and the way people lived in that era.

Past Philosophers and Historians thought of oral history as oral tradition. Now, there is a difference between oral tradition and oral history is that oral tradition is the telling of knowledge using folklore, legends, myths, prayers, songs or chants through time over a groups and generations of people. There is also a lack of authority, whereas oral history is the study of historical information using audio tapes, video tapes, or the transcriptions of eye-witness accounts (Hobbs, Prezi).
