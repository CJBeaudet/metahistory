# Oral History

I plan on writing about why people should care about oral history along with talking about the history of it and the types of oral history there are. I want to start off the essay and answer a *so what* question, and connect oral history to everyday life, and then talk about some of the types and start off by giving a brief intro and summary to the Iliad and talk about why this is a form of oral history. Then I will talk about Oral Interviews and why they are an important form of history. I would maybe like to talk about how to give a correct interview and to stay away from bias and swaying the interview in your own way, but thatâ€™s just an idea. I would like to end my essay talking about the transfer of oral history to written history and how the Vikings are a great example of this.
