When we think about history we often think of folklore, and the stories that are told are often ways people share their traditions and histories. In the past oral history has only been spoken and never really recorded until the technology developed. Today, Oral History has been made into new mediums for all people to have knowledge and access to, like the "*Ted Bundy Tapes*" on Netflix. Netflix has turned these tapes that only certain people had access to because of the technology they had available during the 70's and 80's. Today those tapes have been made into a documentary where people like us can listen to what the infamous serial killer, Ted Bundy, had to say. When we listened to these tapes and heard what Ted Bundy had to say we didn’t question if Bundy was lying or telling the truth in those interviews, but what we did know is that we were hearing Bundy tell his story the way he wanted to tell it. Are there problems with this and the fact we only heard his story the way he wanted us to remember it?

For centuries philosophers and historians have argued why oral history is not a good way to record history because the way people often tell the history of the past gets construed because of the way they remember the event. The ancient Greek historian Thucydides states this as well when he writes his famous book called * The History of the Peloponnesian Wars *. He says, “My conclusions have cost me some labour from the want of coincidence between accounts of the same occurrences by different eyewitnesses, arising sometimes from imperfect memory, sometimes from undue partiality for one side or the other” (Thucydides, 40-41). Thucydides talks about how people remember the same event differently, and often, as the people talk about the event that happened gets twisted and information gets changed. Historians have often disregarded oral history because it can be unreliable for many reasons. Any interview could be bias. The interviewee could be made uncomfortable because of the environment they are in. In the 1930’s, a giant machine called a Magnetophon, or what you may know as a reel to reel, was needed to interview someone. Imagine how loud that machine was and how that would make the interviewee feel uncomfortable. The questions the interviewer asks could be worded in a way that makes the interviewee answer in swayed direction, and that makes the interview as a whole unreliable. Though, not only the interviewer could be bias, but the interviewee could be answering in ways that serve an alternative purpose as well. There is also the case of misremembrance. People telling their history will often forget or add to it making the whole truth unknown.



Past Philosophers and Historians thought of oral history as oral tradition. The difference between oral tradition and oral history is that oral tradition is the telling of knowledge using folklore, legends, myths, prayers, songs or chants through time over a groups and generations of people. There is also a lack of authority, whereas oral history is the study of historical information using audio tapes, video tapes, or the transcriptions of eye-witness accounts (Hobbs,Prezi). Lemon, a philosopher, who wrote the book *Philosophy of History* studied the writing of another famous philosopher named Voltaire and discussed the lack of human progress ancient people had is because of their use of storytelling to understand the natural world around them (Lemon).
