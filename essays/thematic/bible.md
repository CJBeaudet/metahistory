One of the biggest battles in the history of mankind is one that traces its origins all the way back to _Ancient Rome_ and is still going strong today. The epic battle that is being reference is the **Bible vs Science**. This heated battle might be described as having a _David vs Goliath_ feel with each side taking turns playing the role of underdog. This essay won’t go into the actual debates with each side trying to plead their case and dismiss the other, but we will focus more on how the philosophies or thought process shifted through out the years. 

### First Conflict

As we stated above this battle first shows its self in _Ancient Rome_ Christianity had a rough start in the Ancient Rome with believers of Christianity facing heavy persecution, but it would eventually be accepted by Emperor Constantine in 313 AD. 10 years later, 323 AD, Christianity would be named the official religion of the Roman Empire. That is key fact to know because the Romans would use the **Bible** to guide a fair amount of their thinking.

A perfect example of this is the Roman’s believe in **Geocentrism**, thinking that the Earth in the center of the universe with the sun orbiting around it. They believed this because they took what the Bible said literally. There are multiple verses in the Bible that led them to believe in Geocentrism, but the main one that they used was Joshua 10:13: “And the sun stood still and the moon stayed, until the people had avenged themselves upon their enemies. Is not this written in the book of Jasher? So the sun stood still in the midst of heaven, and hasted not to go down about a whole day.” 

This believe went unchallenged for a while because it was written in the scriptures and in those days no on dared to go against the Bible or the Church. If you haven’t already guessed that is foreshadowing for someone to do the unthinkable and challenge things. The person to do this was **Galileo**. 

Galileo made some observations of the moons shape and craters or valleys located on it. Also observing the milky way and distant bright dots around Jupiter. All of these factored into Galileo coming to the conclusion that the earth is not the center of the universe. He made a **Heliocentrism** claim, that the sun is the center of the universe.

_Galileo_ knew that this new thought process would ruffles some feathers so he kept things on the downlow by sending private letters before going public. One of these letters, known as the _Letter to the Grand Duchess Christina_, he argues that the Bible should be taken as incapable of making mistakes when understood correctly and it has little to say in matters of astronomy. “I think that in discussions of physical problems we ought to begin not form the authority of scriptural passages, but from sense-experiences and necessary demonstrations.” (Blackwell, pg 6)

Despite his best efforts Galileo still faced the wrath of the church when they forced him to publicly recant his claims. To be clear the Church didn’t have _scientific problems_ with what Galileo was claiming. They had no other evidence or reason to think different from this claim other than what they thought the Bible was saying. The church had a problem with him defying the final authority of the church.  Galileo did as he was asked, but the damage was done and the seeds of doubts about how to understand the Bible was planted. 

This is what is referred by many of the **Conflict theory**. “On this view, Christianity is cast in the role of the oppressive and stultifying stepmother who held back the young, reasonable, and progressive maiden of science. Then science finally broke free form the oppressive Church and steadily added to our accumulated knowledge and quality of life.” (Blackwell, pg 3)

### Independence, calm before the storm 

Galileo’ discovery and claims against the literal interpretation of the Bible forced a major shift in the way in the way that Science and the Bible interacted. This interaction is classified as **Independence** and is where they both go their separate ways while not intersecting. “At other times in the history of Science and Christianity, the two sides were content to go about their own business without interfering with each other.” (Blackwell, pg 8) 

Even the authority of the Church got on board with the Independence era. **Basil the Great**, an influential bishop at the time, dismissed Greek science as ‘idle chatter’ which was ‘not all useful for the edification of the Church’. (Harrison, pg 12) **Ambrose**, the archbishop of Milan, explaining why the scriptures had little say on scientific matter, wrote that, “There was no place in the words of the Holy Spirit for the vanity of perishable knowledge which deceives and deludes us in our attempt to explain the unexplainable. (Harrison, pg 13) **Saint Augustine**, a major Christian philosopher, was hardly more enthusiastic, declaring that ‘the knowledge collected from the books of pagans, although some of it is useful, is also little as compared with that derived from scripture.’ (Harrison, pg 13) 

This idea of keeping the science and the Bible in their sectors is an idea that is also shared by some in the modern day setting. Leading theologian _Moses Stuart of Andover Seminary_ put in 1829, God fit the world of the Mosaic narrative to the feeling, vies, and methods of expression, existing in the time of Moses… The bible was not designed to teach the Hebrews astronomy or geology.” (Goldberg, pg 28-29)

Along with this era of **independence** there was also a major shift in how the bible was understood. The shift was away from the literal translation that dominated in Ancient Rome. This change in thought was highlighted by **Averroes** and his **double truth theory**. Averroes was a muslim philosopher and one of the most important Arab thinkers of the Middle ages. “The doctrine of double truth meant that a claim could have different meanings at different levels- a literal philosophical meaning and an allegorical or figurative theological meaning.” (Blackwell, pg 9)
