Abstract

Cycles are an important theme that reoccurs through the study and writing of history. From the beginning of written history, cycles have played an important role in shaping the way in which the history of individuals and empires have been written. Historical cycles have been used to describe the history of civilizations, for example, with rise and fall of civilizations like that of the Roman empire or the rise and fall of political institutions. The belief in historical cycles has also shaped the way in which the future is perceived. From Augustine (354-450) to Vico (1668-1744), cycles have been a constant presence in the philosophy of history. Cycles have also shaped a big part of historiography and its study. 

Why does this matter?
