 # Historical Fiction and the Study of History: What is it and what can we learn from it?
 
### Introduction

Novels—fictions of various styles and sub-genres—are quite entertaining and help us escape from the world, for a time.  They expand our concepts of what is and what can be.  The untether us from reality and thrust us in an expanse of diverse and amazing worlds with engrossing characters.  Can they do more?

All writing is, at its essence, an act of creation.  Whether a factual narrative—biographies, memoirs, and narrative histories—or something more inventive—creative history, historical fiction, or alternate fiction—they all convey information and provide us some level of entertainment.  That one group of writers adheres to one set of conventions or another isn’t the issue, rather how well they inform and draw us into the story is far more relevant and persuasive.

Literary writing spans a broad spectrum ranging from Fiction (imaginative and/or speculative) to non-fiction (biography/narrative/analytical).  What are the various classifications of writing in the world of history? What can we glean from the various genres of historical writing?  Lets take a quick look at the major genres of historically-based writing.

 - [Narrative History](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narrative_history) - This form of historical writing is the one we are most familiar with.  Narrative History is ‘fact-based,’ minimizing creative license in the narrative—adding elements that cannot be supported by historical source or the embellishing of fact to enhance the reader’s emotional investment in the narrative.  This genre includes biographies and memoirs.

 - [Creative History or Nonfiction](https://www.creativenonfiction.org/online-reading/what-creative-nonfiction) - Creative History, or nonfiction, takes borrows from the academic narrative and interjects elements that may not be supported by historical sources, yet is consistent with the events and larger narrative.

 - [Historical Fiction](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/historical-fiction) - Based in a documentable historical setting, historical fiction adds elements created by the author that cannot be supported by the historical record.

 - [Alternate History](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/alternative%20history) - A storyline that has a point and time in history as a point of origin, but then diverges from the historical timeline to present a “what if” scenario to the reader, exploring a history that might have been.

 - [Fictional History](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Fictional_history) - These are histories of the real world that do not qualify as alternate history (fictitious histories which diverge from real history before the time of writing).  This genre is often confused with Historical or Alternative Fiction.

 - [Fiction](https://www.britannica.com/art/fiction-literature) - Literature which is in part or completely created by the author.  This overarching genre is very broad and can arguably encompass all of the genres mentioned here with the exception of Narrative History.

We generally understand that history studies the past (Lemon, 293).  From here we move forward to apply those genres that best inform and engage us as its observers, students, and readers.

### Which genres enhance our understanding of history?

It might be better to ask “Which of these genres can not only entertain us, but better inform us about history?  In exploring the question, let’s look at some examples to examine several of these genres as a means of gaining a greater understanding and appreciation of the academic discipline of history.  

It would be fair to say that the least useful to our conversation, in terms of the study of history, are Fiction, Fictional History, and Alternative History.  While interesting, in their own right, they do virtually nothing to expand our understanding of or bring us closer to the historical record.  For this reason, lets continue the discussion with the other three: narrative history, creative history, and historical fiction.  

### Similarities

While narrative history, creative history, and historical fiction differ, they also have much in common.  All three depend on an in-depth knowledge of their critical elements: period, location, and key figures.  This knowledge comes from extensive research into each facet of the overriding narrative arch.  This is done to convey the most accurate and believable depiction of the history.  Without the gathering of credible source material, the author fails to reach their intended audience effectively and credibly.  It is this common foundation that establishes the value of the material beyond that of mere entertainment.

 ### What is historical fiction?  

Historical fiction, is a literary genre that while based in historical events and major characters, uses fictional interactions and secondary characters to create a rich and vivid narrative to engage you, the reader in a manner similar to creative fiction.  But, before we delve into the genre, we need to come to terms with a broader understanding of historical fiction’s place in the literary world.  

The lines between creative history and historical fiction are blurry.  With the injection of dialogues and minor events that are not supported by historical primary sources, yet not fundamentally alter the historical narrative, increase our involvement and interest in the story.

To simplify matters I will simply use ‘historical fiction’ to refer to both historical fiction and creative history.

In fairness, historical fiction is part of a literary spectrum ranging from fiction to Narrative (academic) history, with several stops along the way.  Each of these is part of a spectrum with none holding a fixed position, each arguably blending into the next.

 ### Historical Fiction vs. History

Each of us, remembering our high school World History class, know how dry and uninspiring narrative histories can be.  Names, dates, locations, and people are at the very center of what we were all taught history is ‘supposed to be.’  The facts, just the facts, please. No wonder many of us despised these class, with several falling asleep (no finger pointing here).

Without realizing it at the time, we were all indoctrinated into the Euro-centric and nationalistic histories that colored our understanding of history and the world.  Even today, Euro-centrism and nationalism pervade what is taught to children in schools in the western world.  

Now, what if that the method and tools of teaching history were turned upside-down?  Enter creative history and historical fiction.

 - What has been the past role historical fiction?    

For centuries we have relied on the traditional ‘narrative’ to inform us in the academic world.  Whether Greek ([Ptolemy]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy_I_Soter), [Timaeus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timaeus_(historian)), Roman ([Tacitus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tacitus), [Livy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Livy), [Pliny](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pliny_the_Elder)), Christian ([Augustine](https://www.iep.utm.edu/augustin/), [Eusabius Pamphili](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eusebius), [Socrates of Constantinople](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socrates_of_Constantinople), [Caesar Baronius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_Baronius)), or modern ([Leopold van Ranke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leopold_von_Ranke), [Frederick Jackson Turner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederick_Jackson_Turner), [Voltaire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voltaire)), historians have rejected the idea of anything other than the ’facts for facts sake,’ leaving us with the narrative style we have known throughout our schooling.  While the ‘facts’ are central to the very nature of historical studies, there is a lack of emotion and investiture for us as the readers.

Enter historical fiction.  That this genre goes beyond the absolute historical record, interpolating and intuiting the missing dialogues and minor events adds a vibrancy—excitement—that has long been missing from the chronicle.

Early civilizations—Greeks, Romans, Persians, Chinese—used myths to inform and teach about their origins and place in the world.  This has been done to equal effect within Christendom, with the Old and New Testament stories of The Bible, beginning with the creation myth in the book of Genesis.  Then, as now, these fictions informed the reader (or listener) of the very nature of who they were and where they came from.  These works are, arguably, more fiction than fact yet there is little debate as to their value to the study of history.

Historical Fiction is different.  In fact, it is more historically accurate, by many accounts, than the Greek, Roman, or Christian mythologies.  The bodes well for its utility to us as readers of history.  We strive for accuracy and detail, which is at the heart of historical fiction. 

### Assessing the value of historical fiction?  

Clearly, we can’t accept these works as historical ‘gospel.’  With the addition of fictional elements, we have to differentiate the factual from the contrived.  Even so, the factual portions of these works are enhanced by the inclusion of the fictional aspects.  As long as we understand and recognize the difference, historical fiction can present a greater opportunity to grasp and become involved in the story that narrative histories are unable to accomplish.

### A place for historical fiction in the study of history?

By its very nature, historical fiction is part of the study of history.  Built upon research of the subject matter, these works extend the reach of traditional narrative works.  Authors of the historical fiction genre are, to varying degrees, committed to building a world based on factual, credible evidence to build a firm historical foundation for their work.  Without this foundation, the author and work are lacking in credibility and cast us into a world of fantasy, one that is still engaging but fails to enhance our understanding of the past and draw us into a deeper search into past events, places, and personalities.

### Expanding interest in history?

The author’s passion for the subject of their work and their dedication to the research and accuracy of the presentation carries over to us, the audience.  While they have enhanced the research with development of dialogue and characters we are unable to reconstruct from historical sources, these elements add to our ability to visualize the people, places, and events in a historical context.  Gaining our emotional investment through a more active and engaging environment, historical fiction can act as a tool to increase interest in the historical topic the author is presenting. 

### A recruitment tool?

Increasing the personal involvement in these historical works, though interspersed with fictional elements, drives us to read and investigate the subject through more traditional academic sources and reaching into primary source material.  These inquiries into the past act to increase our interest and involvement in the history.  Integrating works of historical fiction (and creative history) into the academic environment provides a means of drawing more students into the academic study of history. 

### In Closing

The study of history can be quite dry or very engrossing.  Looking back on the past not only tells us about where we came from, but can inform us about where we are going.  It helps to understand ourselves and those around us. It builds skills that serve us in virtually every field of endeavor.  Through research, organization, language, and argumentative writing we are better prepared to face the challenges of the ‘real world.’ But is something missing?

With the addition of well-researched creative history and historical fiction to the study of history we are adding a creative spark that may well be lacking on the field.  Creativity manifests itself in a variety of ways such as invention and expression.  Creativity nourishes, expanding our visions and drawing us closer to who we are.  Should we now deny the very essence of creativity in the study of history?  How can we deny our nature as imaginative and resourceful people?
