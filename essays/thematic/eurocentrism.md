The exact extent of Eurocentrism in contemporary culture, academia, politics, and many other facets of daily life is impossible to determine. While not being solidified as a concept until the Postmodern revolution in the late twentieth century, the traces of Eurocentrism throughout history and the deep-seeded effects it has on all human life today can no longer be ignored. Eurocentrism, as a concept, can be applied to any person, place, or thing throughout history, there is truly nothing untouched by Western imperialism and influence, but for the purposes of this essay, eurocentrism will focus strictly on historiography, or how history has been written, with a Eurocentric perspective and the repercussions of such views. With this in mind, my examination of Eurocentrism is going to begin with one of the first men considered to be a 'historian', Augustine of Hippo. But first, let's understand exactly what is Eurocentrism.

## Eurocentrism: What is it?

Being born in Europe is not always enough to be seen as _European_. This has greatly influenced who has been included in depictions of historical Europe."

In order to understand eurocentrism, we must first understand a different question: What is Europe? That might seem like an obvious question, Europe is a continent east of the Atlantic Ocean. Physically, yes, Europe is a continent, but let's dive into the previous sentence a bit more. "Europe is a continent _east_ of the Atlantic," why _east_? How was that orientation determined? Who decided what was _east_ and what was _west_? This simple view of our contemporary map is a remnant of a Eurocentric past, drawing Europe as the original focus of the globe.

Inherently, the term 'Eurocentric' is easy to parse, 'euro' is Europe and 'centric' is center. Simply, it is that Europe is seen and has historically seen itself as the center of the world, or the focus (more so than the geographical center), and the only 'west' before encountering the Americas, naturally designating all other sectors as 'north', 'south', 'east', or 'west' from that focal point. But, there is much more to Eurocentrism than locality. Europe is also a concept itself. Much like Eurocentrism, Europe is an idea that a group of people collectively came to understand and agree upon. This idea formed into a culture, with certain values and practices which differentiated it from other cultures, until eventually coinciding with a specific image in our heads of what it means to _be 'European'_.

Eurocentrism encompasses many Western concepts (and there very real effects), including colonialism, capitalism, Christianity, racism, patriarchy, and countless other cultural and historical identifiers. However, Eurocentrism itself is not individually any of these concepts, but rather the amalgamation of the hegemonic entity of European culture which through time has influenced the world to such a degree that perspectives have been skewed to view Europe as "better", "more civilized", "more developed", or as a "First World Country" in comparison to non-European regions. Eurocentrism has acted as both the motivation for and the outcome of many of these listed concepts, giving it its complex, multilayered identity.

## Origins

Many authors of Eurocentrism trace its origins as far back as ancient Greece, located in Southeast Europe, acting as a continental "crossroad" between Europe, Africa, and Asia, and the origin of textual historical documents. For centuries, the Mediterranean was seen as not only the origin of European culture, but as the origin of humans themselves, civilization, democracy, and philosophy. With a political system based on imperialism, that is expanding of an empire, and colonialism, the control or occupancy of another government, it is undeniable that the foundation for Eurocentrism began in Greece. However, Eurocentrism today has a much more layered, complex interaction with the world which is more closely linked to the late Roman period, around the fifth century.

> **Fun Fact:** The term "Barbarian" is actually a Greek term used to describe anyone who did not speak Koine Greek, the common language in ancient Greece. 'ian' means "one who speaks" and 'bar' describes what Grecians thought non-Greek languages sounded like, "barbarbarbar".

In response to the Roman defeat by the Visigoths in 410CE, Bishop Augustine of Hippo wrote a document titled _City of God_. This document's intention was to explain the reasons for Roman defeat and attempt to understand human history. However, as historians, we can examine this document for much more than its _intended_ purpose. Augustine redefined history as not only a Western one, but as a Christian one. This is a belief that will become the basis for contemporary Eurocentrism, much more permeating than the Greeks ever employed. With the addition of Christianity to Western, European identity, the concept of paternalism, or Europe viewing itself as a 'father' to the rest of the world, soon intertwined with this identity. Stemming from paternalistic views already well-developed in the Roman-Catholic church, think of the male-dominated clergy, such as the Pope, archbishop, bishops, etc. roles which can only be held by males and the view of the Christian god himself as a man and father, this new understanding of Europeanism would not only provincialize all non-European countries, but would also position them as children needing to be cared for by their European 'father'.

> _Pro.vin.cial, adj.: of or concerning the regions outside the capital city of a country, especially when regarded as unsophisticated or narrow-minded._ **Provincialism** refers to the biproduct of Eurocentrism. While Europe positioned itself as the center of the world, all other countries were 'provincialized', or seen as on the "outskirts" of history, rather than as active participants. Additionally this view strengthened European ideas of non-Europeans as 'children', who were uneducated, pagan, 'backward', and in need of assistance, or being 'saved'.

## Postmodernism to Present

Historians today are able to study events in the past and understand them as Eurocentric, but why did it take so long for this to become a part of historiographical and social discussion? In the late twentieth century, a movement began known as 'Postmodernism', in response to 'Modernism' which believed in universalities and metanarratives as useful techniques for understanding cultures around the world. On the other side, Postmodernism sought to 'break down' all of the ideas of Modernism and establish that all people had different views of 'reality' and no one reality could be seen as the only 'true' version of events. Today, this is now a much more common understanding of history, but it is still a relatively recent view and application by historians.

One theory of why this view at last took hold in the twentieth century is due to what Chinese historian, Robert B. Marks, refers to as "the Gap". By the twentieth century, the economic gap between "first" and "third" world countries had become so severe and obvious that the direct and indirect effects of colonialism could no longer be denied and hidden. While countries with the highest populations, such as India and most African countries, had the lowest annual incomes and revenue, countries which much smaller populations, such as England or United States of America, earned the highest annual incomes and revenues. These distinct differences in quality of life caused many historians to retrace the past in order to understand why these gaps had occurred. As a result, new terms like hegemony, anti-colonialism, and Eurocentrism made their way into mainstream discussions.

Note how 'development' is still defined by Eurocentric ideals, such as economy type, industrialization, and systemized education."
