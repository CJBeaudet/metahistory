This essay will explain to a novice historian what Eurocentrism is, how/where/when it began, how it has effected historical writings and continues to today. I will provide examples to demonstrate how this has been done and the dangers that come with this practice. I will further explain why, as historians, it is important to recognize these types of biases in both historical and our own writings. Depending on scope, I may also explain provincialism and its birth as a result of Eurocentrism. This topic will also, naturally, discuss the (recent) changes in historical practice which are shifting away from a western-dominated, male-centric, Christian, white, upper-class perspective and perceived legitimacy to a broadening acceptance of a variety of stories and perspectives from previously 'provincialized' sectors.
