The Bible might be one of, if not the, most important books in the history of mankind. Laws have been created because of it, societies have been centered around it, and lives have been changed due to it. At every point in history the Bible has left its mark on the world and shows no signs of stopping. The biggest question that always comes up is how true is it?

Historiography deals with the study or analysis of history and its sources to determine how much of what is being said is truth. Some methods that are used in this process are looking at the authors potential bias on what they are reporting. One has to look at their overall message and weighing how much of their story supports their arguement. Looking for the dark areas that they left out because it may hurt their version of the story. Looking at the evidence and if it supports or conflicts with the version of truth we are being presented. In this essay we will explore the Bible with these questions in mind.
