In 1853, four U.S. Navy ships, commanded by Commodore Matthew Perry, entered Edo Bay.  Perry's orders were to demand that Japan end its 200 year old policy of global isolation, known as **Sakoku**, and open itself to American trade.  This act of **gunboat diplomacy** would not only have a profound impact on Japan, but on the entire world.  In ten years, the Tokugawa Shogunate would fall, and the Emperor, for centuries merely a figurehead, would be reestablished as the center of Japanese polity.  In fifty years, the country would have so rapidly modernizied, adapting to western ways of education, medicine, and war, that they were primed to to challenge the West for colonial domininace of Asia.  Throughout this process, the way Japanese scholars viewed their past went through sezimic shifts.  Japan, and its history now had to be viewed through the lens of a larger world.  Western methods of historiography would be studied, and implemented, to form the identity of a "Japanese" civilization.


### History in the Tokugawa Period
Tokugawa Ieyasu's victory at the Battle of Sekigahara in 1600 led to an era of political stability Japan had not seen for centuries.  While the Yamato Dynasty, Japan's Imperial Family, had, in theory, ruled uninterruptedly since the the 7th century, they had been little more than figureheads since the 12th century, when military rulers, known as **shoguns**, rose to power.  Brief periods of stability would give way to eras of civil strife.  Military leaders, such as Oda Nobunaga, would come close to unifying the land, but ultimately fall short.  The Tokugawa would succeed where all other had failed.  This period of peace and prosperity would see a flourishing of literature and the arts.  

The writing of history was no exception.  While the output may have increased, the philosophy and methodology of history had changed little since the compiling of Japan's earliest historical texts, the **Kokiji** and the **Nihon Shoki** in the 8th century.  History was still written under the authority of the government, with the primary purpose to justify their rule.  It was still being written in Chinese, the prefered language of male scholars, and used the Confucian methodology of evidence gathering.  It was only in the twilight of the Tokugawa Period, when historians such as **Motoori Norinaga** and **Rai Sanyo**, began to produce works that challenged those in power.  Motoori's study of the *Kokiji* put into question the validity of shogunate rule, which inspired Rai's own *Nihongaishi*, a more directly critical take on the Tokugawa.  (Borton 493-494)

### Continuity and Disruption




### The Founding of Historiographical Bureau

### History and the State
Kunitake's elevated status at the Imperial University was short-lived.  In 1892, he wrote an article that would immediately cast him out of favor with Imperial authorities.  _Shinto Is an Outdated Custom of Heaven Worship_ was a take down of the very state-sponsered religion that the Imperial Household was using to maintain its legitimacy, calling into question their historical descendence from **Amaterasu**, the sun goddess, and most important figure in Shinto mythology.  While Kunitake was able to able to continue writing, and eventually found work a private university, he was finished at the Historiographical Bureau.  That none of his colleagues stood up for him was a sign of things to come, as **State Shinto** and Japanese militarism grew in the 20th century.

### Heroes of the Past

Historians such as Yamaji Aizan worked outside the influence of the Historiographical Bureau.  Yamaji's populistic beliefs led him to promote the idea of invidual agency, and the powerful role of the _hero_ in nation building.  These ideas were inspired by the work of **Thomas Carlyle**, a 19th century Scottish philosopher and historian, who was an early advocate of the **Great Man Theory** of history.  His work, *On Heroes, Hero-Worship, and the Heroic in History*, was one of many western texts translated into Japanese during the later half of the 19th century.  Yamaji embraced these heroic ideals, and wrote embellished biographies of "great men" throughout Japanese history.  Powerful shoguns, such as Minamoto Yoritomo, Ashikaga Takauji, and even the founder of the so recently deposed Tokugawa Shogunate, were represented as civilizing heroes.  The inclusion of Saig≈ç Takamori, one of the founders of the Restoration, who eventually rejected the westernization of the military, and led the failed **Satsuma Rebellion** of 1877, reveals how rapidly the mythologizing process was taking place.  Yamaji's advocacy of Japan's Imperial ambitions led to a unifying of all Japanese heroes, though none had ever fought for the nation state that had emerged from the Restoration.
