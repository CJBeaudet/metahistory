### Continuity and Disruption




### The Founding of Historiographical Bureau

### History and the State
Kunitake's elevated status at the Imperial University was short-lived.  In 1892, he wrote an article that would immediately cast him out of favor with Imperial authorities.  _Shinto Is an Outdated Custom of Heaven Worship_ was a take down of the very state-sponsered religion that the Imperial Household was using to maintain its legitimacy, calling into question their historical descendence from **Amaterasu**, the sun goddess, and most important figure in Shinto mythology.  While Kunitake was able to able to continue writing, and eventually found work a private university, he was finished at the Historiographical Bureau.  That none of his colleagues stood up for him was a sign of things to come, as **State Shinto** and Japanese militarism grew in the 20th century.

### Heroes of the Past
Historians such as Yamaji Aizan worked outside the influence of the Historiographical Bureau.  Yamaji's populistic beliefs led him to promote the idea of invidual agency, and the powerful role of the _hero_ in nation building.  These ideas were inspired by the work of **Thomas Carlyle**, a 19th century Scottish philosopher and historian, who was an early advocate of the **Great Man Theory** of history.  His work, *On Heroes, Hero-Worship, and the Heroic in History*, was one of many western texts translated into Japanese during the later half of the 19th century.  Yamaji embraced these heroic ideals, and wrote embellished biographies of "great men" throughout Japanese history.  Powerful shoguns, such as Minamoto Yoritomo, Ashikaga Takauji, and even the founder of the so recently deposed Tokugawa Shogunate, were represented as civilizing heroes.  The inclusion of Saig≈ç Takamori, one of the founders of the Restoration, who eventually rejected the westernization of the military, and led the failed **Satsuma Rebellion** of 1877, reveals how rapidly the mythologizing process was taking place.  Yamaji's advocacy of Japan's Imperial ambitions led to a unifying of all Japanese heroes, though none had ever fought for the nation state that had emerged from the Restoration.
