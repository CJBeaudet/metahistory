This essay will recount the radical changes in Japanese historiography, starting in 1868, at the onset of the **Meiji Restoration**, through the end of the Showa era, in 1989.  Each section of the essay will begin with a brief paragraph containing the historical context neccessary for a student unfamiliar with Japanese history, to be followed by more indepth summary of historiographical subject matter.  Topics will include the influence of **Ludwig Riess**, **Fukuzawa Yuichi** and his work _An Outline of a Theory of Civilization_, the 1869 founding of the **Historiographical Institute of the University of Tokyo**, historian **Kume Kunitake** and his criticisms of State Shinto, the post-war Marxism of the **Ostuka Historical School**, as well as the rise of nationalist historiography both before and after the Second World War.

The purpose of this essay will be to show the impact of western historiography on non-western nations, not through colonization, but by full-scale adoption.  Modern Japanese historiography allows us to view the interplay between western and non-western historiographical traditions, and how that can shape the destiny of a nation.
