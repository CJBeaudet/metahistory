## HISTORIOGRAPHY

This essay will examine the official historical account of the genocide that occurred in Rwanda, 1994. It aims to compare the similarities and differences of how the history of the genocide was written, portrayed, understood, and perceived today. The reality of ‘what really happened’ and the country’s national history of ‘what really happened’ are far from the same. As history is often written and remembered by the victors, a closer examination of the Rwandan genocide reveals a story of government coverups, secrecy, and the suppression of voice by many. Historiography is the study of how history is written, understood, perceived, and interpreted. I will attempt to show how the history of a nation was intentionally manipulated, by the method of partiality, to restore the practical necessity of order within the country. 
> "Thus, a practically motivated study of something is partial both in the sense that it does not study its material fully but only those 'parts' relevant to its objective - and in the sense that the thinking involved demonstrates a 'partiality' towards lines of thinking and conclusions appropriate or 'convenient' to one's purposes. Although this does not mean the understandings achieved will necessarily be false (although such a danger threatens), it does mean the study, as angled towards the ends sought, will be 'distorted” (287). -Lemon

This essay will be constructed in a framework designed to guide the reader in a manner that provides a better understanding of how the ‘history of history’ pertains to Rwanda. It will provide the historical context concerning the genocide, but will focus rather on how we understand the history of the event and how this history effects the nation today. The framework of the essay will be constructed as follows: First, data collection of empirical evidence (primary resources) will be gathered to understand the ‘full’ context. Second, critical comparison of empirical evidence to the historical understanding (official or unofficial) is needed to interpret how the event was perceived and portrayed. Third, understanding how the common believed history of the nation effects the nation today and how a believed history may be used for practical purposes. 


## Introduction

History often provides people with the perception of a true story, a story all too often perceived to be a close reality of an event or series of events. This essay aims to show how an untold story brings fuller context to the history of Rwanda and how such history underlies a closer ‘truth’ to reality. To study history and come to an understanding closer to that which is truth (as should be the historian’s goal), as well as understanding how history is made to become truth, historiography plays a critical role in determining how we might otherwise understand the history of a country and reach alternative conclusions to that which is often perceived to be history and truth. 

## Historical Context

The country of Rwanda is a beautiful place full of attractive landscapes, abundance of resources, wonderful people, and exceptionally unique culture. However, aside from these positive attributes, recent events in past decades have unfolded within the country that has resulted in murder, rape, starvation, disease, homelessness, mass genocide, and war crime atrocities.

An estimation of approximately 1,000,000 casualties and 5,000,000 refugees have been displaced from their homes in Rwanda as a result of civil war between two opposing tribes, the Hutu and the Tutsi. Tensions and disputes between the two tribes has long withstood, but following the first World War, under the Treaty of Versailles, the League of Nations permitted Belgian occupation of formerly German occupied Rwanda. Belgium, favoring the Tutsi minority over the Hutu majority, gave the tribe special privileges such as western-style education and authority to govern and rule over Rwanda, including governance of the Hutu. This colonial influence of power to the Tutsi tribe largely contributed to the escalation of conflict from dispute to total war between the Hutu and the Tutsi tribes.

### Hutu Revolution 

In 1957, the **PARMEHUTU** (Party for the Emancipation of the Hutus) formed to rebel against Tutsi rule. Shortly thereafter, in 1959, the Hutu militia revolted against the Tutsi monarchy and asserted dominance and authority over the country. The Hutu revolution, otherwise known as the “social revolution”, forced evacuation of approximately 150,000 Tutsi people into refugee camps in nearby Burundi and Uganda. The Hutu remained in control of Rwanda for the next 35 years, elected official Juvénal Habyarimana as president.

### Rwandan Patriotic Front 

In 1988, a counter political party was formed called the **Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF)**, formed by Tutsi exiles in Uganda. Its goal was aimed to retake control of Rwanda for the Tutsi people. Two years after it’s formation, in 1990, the RPF invaded Rwanda and fought for control for 3 years until the Arusha Peace Accords were signed on August 3rd, 1993. The treaties promised compromise for each tribe and an attempt for negotiations of political representation.


### Presidential Assasination 

On April 6th, 1994, **President Juvenal Habyarimana** (Rwanda) and his counterpart Cyprien Ntaryamira (Burundi), both Hutu, had just taken off flight when suddenly the plane they were travelling on was shot out of the sky, instantly killing both of them as well as everyone else on board. The cause of this event was clear to have been intentional, but further investigation to determine who carried out the action was not clear. Nevertheless, the assassination sparked outrage of Hutu tribesmen who blamed the RPF. The Hutu quickly organized armed militias and sought to retaliate. Once organized, the Hutu ended the cease-fire ended and violence erupted.

### 100 Day Massacre

Following the assassination, the **National Republican Movement for Democracy and Development** (MRND) organized themselves to seek retaliation against Tutsi civilians. An all-out genocide campaign was ordered out to kill all Tutsi members in the country. Roadblocks and blockades were constructed, and travelers checked of their tribal orientation based on identification (ID) cards. Radio broadcasts were transmitted throughout the country to order Hutu members to kill their neighbors. The Hutu militias continued to storm Rwandan cities, successfully capturing cities, including the capital Kigali. Within 100 days, approximately 800,000 Tutsi civilians were murdered, raped, and cities pillaged. Indiscriminate in their killings, the NRMD killed men, women, and children.

### RPF Control

In 1990, the RPF led a military coalition against the MRND to stop the genocide and retake control of the country. After months of fighting the civil war, the RPF began to successfully capture the Rwandan cities. By July 4th, 1994, the RPF captured control of the capital Kigali and on July 18th, 1994, gained control of the entire country. The elected president, Paul Kagame, rose to power as the national president of Rwanda and remains in that position today, 25 years later.

### Tutsi Refugee

As the RPF regained military and political control of Rwanda, Hutu survivors feared that retallion against them would soon occur.... (to be continued).
