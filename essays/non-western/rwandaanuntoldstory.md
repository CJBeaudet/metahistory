## Historiography of Rwanda

As history is often written by the victors, this essay will examine the official historical account of the genocide which occured in Rwanda, 1994. It aims to study how the history of the genocide was written, portrayed, and perhaps manipulated. History provides us with the perception of a true story, a story all too often percieved to be the reality of an event or series of events. This essay aims to show how an untold story of Rwanda brings fuller context to the conflict of Rwanda and how such a story of history underlies a closer truth to reality. To further study a history closer to truth, as should be the historians purpose, the discipline of historiography plays a critical role in understanding the story of Rwanda. It is merely the purpose of this essay to interpret the historical sources and examine just how the history of Rwanda was written, portrayed, and percieved (the history of history) and also show how the relationship between history and truth can be distorted.

## Introduction

The country of Rwanda is a beautiful place full of attractive landscapes, abundance of resources, wonderful people, and exceptionally unique culture. However, aside from these positive attributes, recent events in past decades have unfolded within the country that has resulted in murder, rape, starvation, disease, homelessness, mass genocide, and war crime atrocities. 


## Background

An estimatation of approximately 1,000,000 casualties and 5,000,000 refugees have been displaced from their homes in Rwanda as a result of civil war between two opposing tribes, the Hutu and the Tutsi. Tensions and disputes between the two tribes has long withstood, but following the first World War, under the Treaty of Versailles, the League of Nations permitted Belgian occupation of formerly German occupied Rwanda. Belgium, favoring the Tutsi minority over the Hutu majority, gave the tribe special priviledges such as western-style education and authority to govern and rule over Rwanda, including governance of the Hutu. This colonial influence of power to the Tutsi tribe largely contributed to the escalation of conflict from dispute to total war between the Hutu and the Tutsi tribes.

### Hutu Revolution 

In 1957, the **PARMEHUTU** (Party for the Emancipation of the Hutus) formed to rebel against Tutsi rule. Shortly thereafter, in 1959, the Hutu militia revolted against the Tutsi monarchy and asserted dominance and authority over the country. The Hutu revolution, otherwise known as the the "social revolution", forced evacuation of approximately 150,000 Tutsi people into refugee camps in nearby Burundi and Uganda. The Hutu remained in control of Rwanda for the next 35 years, elected offcial Juv√©nal Habyarimana as president. 

### Rwandan Patriotic Front 

In 1988, a counter politcal party was formed called the **Rwandan Patriotic Front** (RPF), formed by Tutsi exhiles in Uganda. It's goal was aimed to retake control of Rwanda for the Tutsi people. Two years after it's formattion, in 1990, the RPF invaded Rwanda and fought for control for 3 years until the Arusha Peace Accords wetre signed on August 3rd, 1993. The treaties promised compromise for each tribe and an attempt for negotiations of political representation. 


### Assasination 

On April 6th, 1994, **President Juvenal Habyarimana** (Rwanda) and his counterpart Cyprien Ntaryamira (Burundi), both Hutu, had just taken off flight when suddenly the plane they were travelling on was shot out of the sky, instantly killing both of them as well as everyone else on board. The cause of this event was clear to have been intentional, but investigation of who carried out the action was not clear. Nevertheless, the assasination sparked outrage of Hutu tribesmnen who blamed the RPF and sought to retaliate. The cease-fire ended and violence erupted. 

### 100 Day Massacre

Following the assasination of President Juvenal Habyarimana, the **National Republican Movement for Democracy and Development** (MRND) organized themselves to seek retaliation against Tutsi civilians. An all out genocide campaign was ordered out to kill all Tutsi members in the country. Roadblocks and blockades were constructed and travlelers checked of their tribal orientation based on identification (ID) cards. Radio broadcasts were transmitted throughout the country to order Hutu members to kill their neighbors. The Hutu militias continued to storm Rwandan cities, successfully capturing cities, including the capitol Kigali. Within 100 days, approximately 800,000 Tutsi civilians were murdered, raped, and cities pillaged. Indiscrimante in their killings, the NRMD killed men, women, and children. 

### RPF Control

In 1990, the RPF led a military coalition against the MRND to stop the genocide and retake control of the country. After months of fighting the civil war, the RPF began to sucessfully capture the Rwandan cities. By July 4th, 1994, the RPF captured contol of the capital Kigali and on July 18th, 1994, gained control of the entire country. The elected president Paul Kagame, rose to power as the national president of Rwanda and remains in that position today, 25 years later.
