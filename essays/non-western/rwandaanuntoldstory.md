The country of Rwanda is a beautiful place full of attractive landscapes, wonderful people, and an exceptionally unique culture. However, aside from these positive attributes, recent events have unfolded within the country in the past couple decades that has resulted in murder, carnage, mass genocide, and war crime atrocities. It is estimated that approximately one million casualties and five million displaced refugees has resulted from civil war between two tribes, the Hutu and the Tutsi. Since the late 50's, the Hutu and Tutsi tribes have warred against each other to gain dominant control of the country. As history is often written by the victors, this essay will aim to examine the official historical account of the war, how the history of the war was intentionally altered by method of partiality, and how an untold story of Rwanda brings fuller context to the conflict that underlies a closer truth. To understand a closer truth, as should be the historians purpose, the discipline of historiography plays a critical role towards understanding Rwanda. It is merely the purpose of this essay to interpret the historical sources and examine just how the history of Rwanda was written (the history of history) and also to show how the relationship between history and truth are sometimes (intentionally) twisted.
