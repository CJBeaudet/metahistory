## What is Historiography

The study of history is essential in understanding how to interact with what is being taught. **Historiography** can be quite a daunting word, especially when professors and historians define it as " the critical assessment of how historians try to reconstruct past events from the statements they make about the past."  Though this explanation is used to found fancy and knowledgeable, it does not clear up any confusion. The more natural way of thinking about historiography is that it is the study of how people thought, wrote and perceived history. Through historiography is vastly different than a standard account, events don't matter but instead how people have received the knowledge. It's important to understand that *there is no right or wrong way* of thinking about history. This becomes more prevalent in the overall study of Historiography as new ideas about the study of history and 
*the rule of the historian change all the time*, leading to the rise of debates over the best methods. Though, as a rising historian, you'll be taught by your professors that the most recent way of thinking, in this instance, **post-modernism** is the correct way it is up to the individual historian to develop their way of thinking, even if it is against the current method. In history, there is no absolute truth; thus, there is no correct way of thinking about history, but it is crucial to see how others felt about history as it can reveal the lost voices behind the written word. 
## The Rise of a Historian
**Polybius** ( c. 208-125 bc) was a Greco- Roman philosopher. Born around 208 BC in Megalopolis, Arcadia, within the **Achaean League** at that time. This League was a federation of city-states within the remaining Greek land, which was allied with Rome until their dissolution in 146 BC. This League was fighting against the **Antigonid Macedon**, who was ruled under a tyrant king. Polybius’s father, **Lycortas,** however, brought the attention of Romans when he began expressing anti-Roman rule beliefs. Lycortas believed that the Achaean League was the last Greek power that would have been able to stop the expansion of Rome into the ancient land. **Philopoemen,** the leader of the Achaean League, wanted Roman to acknowledge the Achaean League was an equal power within the Mediterranean and through his policies, was able to keep out the looming republic up until his death. This brought the Roman empire over to Greece, and thus 1000 members of the League were taken as hostages in 146 BC with Polybius being among those chosen. Polybius was taken in by **Publius Cornelius Scipio**, a Consul within the Roman Republic. As such, Polybius was allowed to move around relatively freely in his captive state, leading him to learn about Roman history as well as travel with his master during the Punic Wars in which is book Histories is about. Though Polybius wasn’t able to express his negative views on Rome, his book was used to explain the expansion of Roman control over the Mediterranean as the republic gain control of vast amounts of land as the result of the Punic Wars.
