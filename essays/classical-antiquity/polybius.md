Within this essay I plan on looking at the historigraphic impact of Polybius's ideas and work through looking at his book " The Histories". In doing so, compairing the before and after methidologies of historriography to see the amount of imediate impact he has. In this essay I plan going through brief background history as well so that this paper will be usable and easy to understand for freshmen. This will include questions like: What is Historiography, how was Historiography practiced prior, who was Polybius, what was his work, what was the history behind what he wrote about, how did his work change the view of historiography, and the most important question, why does this matter/ why should we care?

## What is Historiography

The study of history is essential in understanding how to interact with what is being taught. **Historiography** can be quite a daunting word, especially when professors and historians define it as " the critical assessment of how historians try to reconstruct past events from the statements they make about the past."  Though this explanation is used to found fancy and knowledgeable, it does not clear up any confusion. The more natural way of thinking about historiography is that it is the study of how people thought, wrote and perceived history. Through historiography is vastly different than a standard account, events don't matter but instead how people have received the knowledge. It's important to understand that *there is no right or wrong way* of thinking about history. This becomes more prevalent in the overall study of Historiography as new ideas about the study of history and 
*the rule of the historian change all the time*, leading to the rise of debates over the best methods. Though, as a rising historian, you'll be taught by your professors that the most recent way of thinking, in this instance, **post-modernism** is the correct way it is up to the individual historian to develop their way of thinking, even if it is against the current method. In history, there is no absolute truth; thus, there is no correct way of thinking about history, but it is crucial to see how others felt about history as it can reveal the lost voices behind the written word.
