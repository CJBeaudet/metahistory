## What is Historiography

The study of history is essential in understanding how to interact with what is being taught. **Historiography** can be quite a daunting word, especially when professors and historians define it as " the critical assessment of how historians try to reconstruct past events from the statements they make about the past."  Though this explanation is used to found fancy and knowledgeable, it does not clear up any confusion. The more natural way of thinking about historiography is that it is the study of how people thought, wrote and perceived history. Through historiography is vastly different than a standard account, events don't matter but instead how people have received the knowledge. It's important to understand that *there is no right or wrong way* of thinking about history. This becomes more prevalent in the overall study of Historiography as new ideas about the study of history and 
*the rule of the historian change all the time*, leading to the rise of debates over the best methods. Though, as a rising historian, you'll be taught by your professors that the most recent way of thinking, in this instance, **post-modernism** is the correct way it is up to the individual historian to develop their way of thinking, even if it is against the current method. In history, there is no absolute truth; thus, there is no correct way of thinking about history, but it is crucial to see how others felt about history as it can reveal the lost voices behind the written word. 
## The Rise of a Historian
**Polybius** ( c. 208-125 bc) was a Greco- Roman philosopher. Born around 208 BC in Megalopolis, Arcadia, within the **Achaean League** at that time. This League was a federation of city-states within the remaining Greek land, which was allied with Rome until their dissolution in 146 BC. This League was fighting against the **Antigonid Macedon**, who was ruled under a tyrant king. Polybius’s father, **Lycortas,** however, brought the attention of Romans when he began expressing anti-Roman rule beliefs. Lycortas believed that the Achaean League was the last Greek power that would have been able to stop the expansion of Rome into the ancient land. **Philopoemen,** the leader of the Achaean League, wanted Roman to acknowledge the Achaean League was an equal power within the Mediterranean and through his policies, was able to keep out the looming republic up until his death. This brought the Roman empire over to Greece, and thus 1000 members of the League were taken as hostages in 146 BC with Polybius being among those chosen. Polybius was taken in by **Publius Cornelius Scipio**, a Consul within the Roman Republic. As such, Polybius was allowed to move around relatively freely in his captive state, leading him to learn about Roman history as well as travel with his master during the Punic Wars in which is book Histories is about. Though Polybius wasn’t able to express his negative views on Rome, his book was used to explain the expansion of Roman control over the Mediterranean as the republic gain control of vast amounts of land as the result of the Punic Wars. 
## Shot Heard Around the World: Roman Edition
During this time of **Hellenistic Greece**, there is the startling decline of cultural and political importance as the golden age of Greece had already come and gone. The Hellenistic period could be characterized by the time between Alexander the Great and the conquering of the Greek City-States by Rome. It was also during this time that outside thinkers saw Rome as the new world leader as in the 53 years between *220 BC 10 167 BC*, they were the only nation known to have conquered the entire world which had been identified at this point. This rising power was in *stark contrast* to Greece's main rivals of the Persians and the Spartans, who had tried for centuries to conquer the known world without luck. It was this power that leads to Polybius developing an explanation for Romes's power and the reason behind their success while all others failed. 
## *Histories*, The Book Lost to Man
While Polybius was held captive in Rome, he wrote his book *Histories*, which encompassed the history of Rome from 264 BC to 146 BC with a primary focus on the **Punic Wars** along with commentary on the historical profession and methods. His work encompasses mainly the 36 books that make up the *Histories*; however, much of the work has been lost over the years. Due to his unique circumstances, he was allowed to travel around with Scipio and gain first-hand experience and eyewitnesses of the **Sacking of Carthage** and other battles. The 7th book of the histories is the most important one out of the entire collection as it is the book that encompasses Polybius's historiographical theories the most. His main ideas contain source analysis, universal history, cycle theory of Rome, and factual integrity of historical writing. Though it is essential to understand that during the time of writing, Polybius was still a captive of Rome, and some of these ideas, such as the cycles of Rome as well as the history that is written, might be heavily biased towards Roman readers. He then also plays upon his experiences of Roman power to justify his advocation of universal history as this type of historiographical work could not have been possible if their known wold hadn’t been unified under one authority.
