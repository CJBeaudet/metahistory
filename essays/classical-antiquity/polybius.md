**The motivation of the victors masks the voices of the imprisoned.** These words rang true for the Greek historian Polybius. Polybius was a member of a political group within Greece and was one of the remaining few attempting to push back against the power of the Roman Republic. Though taken prisoner by the Romans, he was allowed to travel around with generals and attend political meetings. This freedom not only allowed him to move around the known world but to witness historical events firsthand. His literary freedom was less, however, and his most famous written work, _Histories_, was published under the watchful eyes of Roman rulers. Polybius’s circumstances forced him to write about, if not view, Rome favorably while developing theories to explain their superiority within the Mediterranean. (Eckstein, 10)

## The Rise of a Historian
[Polybius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polybius) (c. 208-125 BCE) was a Greco-Roman philosopher, born around 208 BCE in Megalopolis, Arcadia, within the _Achaean League_, a federation of city-states within the remaining Greek land, which was allied with Rome until their dissolution in 146 BCE. The league was fighting against the Antigonid Macedonian Empire, which was ruled under a tyrant king. Polybius’s father, Lycortas, however, gained the attention of the Romans when he began expressing his anti-Roman rule beliefs. Lycortas believed that the Achaean League was the last Greek power that would be able to stop the expansion of Rome into Greece.

Philopoemen, the leader of the Achaean League, wanted Rome to acknowledge that the Achaean League was an equal power within the Mediterranean and through his policies was able to keep out the looming republic up until his death. This brought the Roman empire to Greece, and thus 1000 members of the league were taken as hostages, with Polybius being among them. Polybius was taken in by Publius Cornelius Scipio, a Consul within the Roman Republic. As such, Polybius was allowed to move around relatively freely in his captive state, leading him to learn about Roman history and travel with his master during the Punic Wars, which inspired _Histories_. Though Polybius was not able to express his negative views on Rome, his book was used to explain the expansion of Roman control over the Mediterranean as the republic gained control of vast amounts of land as the result of the Punic Wars.

## From Greece to Rome
The Greek Hellenistic period could be characterized as the time between Alexander the Great and the conquering of the Greek City-States by Rome. It was also during this time, between 220 BC and 167 BC, that outside thinkers saw Rome as the new world leader as they were the only nation known to have conquered the entire identifiable world.  This rising power was in stark contrast to Greece's main rivals, the Persians and the Spartans, who had tried for centuries to conquer the known world without luck. It was this power that led to Polybius developing an explanation for Rome’s power and the reason behind their success while all others failed.

## The _Histories_
While Polybius was a captive in Rome, he wrote his anthology _Histories_, which encompassed the history of Rome from 264 BC to 146 BC with a primary focus on the [Punic Wars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punic_Wars) as well as commentary on the historical profession and its methods. Due to his unique circumstance, Polybius was allowed to travel with Scipio and gain first-hand experience and eyewitness accounts of important battles such as the Sacking of Carthage.

As far as historiography is concerned, the 7th book of the _Histories_ is the most important of the entire collection as it is the book that encompasses the majority of Polybius's historical methodology. His main ideas contain source analysis, universal history, cycle theory of Rome, and factual integrity of historical writing. These new historical methods were significantly different from previous methods, as history was nationally focused on third-party knowledge. Though it is essential to understand that during the time of writing, Polybius was still a captive of Rome, and some of these ideas, such as the cycles of Rome as well as the history that was written, are likely to be heavily biased towards Roman readers. He also played upon his experiences of Roman power to justify his advocation of universal history, as this type of historiographical work could not have been possible if their known world had not been unified under one authority.

## Rome: The Champion of the Cycle
With Rome rising as the main power of the Mediterranian, many philosophers tried to explain their success. The concept of cyclical thought through political means was not a new concept by the time Polybius stepped forward with his version of it. Though other historians stuck to a **three-part cycle,** Polybius expanded on other ideas which led to his **six-part cycle.** These cycles were both social and political, and also followed a biological period in which a civilization went through birth, flowing, degeneration, death, and renewal. Polybius’s ideas were unique as each part of the period had *both a pristine and corrupt version.* He believed that every city-state experienced the cycle in which one state begins, eventually becomes corrupt, and then is overthrown by the following city-state. His sequence goes as follows: *Monarchy, Tyranny, Aristocracy, Oligarchy, Democracy, Ochlocracy*(Polybius, 6.4). It is then that Monarchy takes over control once again, and then the cycle starts itself over again. Polybius does not explain this cycle within his book but instead insists that *"No clearer proof of the truth of what I say could be obtained than by a careful observation of the natural origin, genesis, and decadence of these several forms of government."* (Polybius 6.4) Though Polybius himself said that it was nearly impossible that any city-state was able to get out of this trend, Rome was able to do it.

## The Champion of Cycles
Many Hellenistic philosophers played with the idea of a natural cyclical trend that encompassed the Mediterranean powers allowing them to explain the rise and fall of empires throughout history. Yet it was Polybius who suggested that Rome had managed to get knocked out of the cycle and become the supreme power of the time. Polybius attributes this success **to two main characteristics; their political and military achievements.** From the military results, he believed that by conquering other city-states in various stages of the cycle, they were able to find the faults and strengths within each political system and adapt accordingly. Polybius attributes most of Rome’s success to its unique form of government and its constitution. Polybius explains that the Roman Republic’s political system was a *combination of Monarchic, Aristocratic, and Democratic* and that it was this mixed political system that saved them from the fate of the political cycle. Other philosophers came to this same conclusion during Polybius’s lifetime, however, he believed that it was because of the juridical capabilities within this political system and not the mixture of the system itself. This mixed political system was another way that Rome was seen as superior in Polybius's eyes.


## Who Gets to Write History
Through the _Histories_, Polybius voices his opinion on who he believed should be writing about history as well as how it should be written for future audiences. He believed that anyone who writes history should have political education and first-hand experience about the topic. His opinion corresponds with the type of writings of the period, which was heavily militarized. Thus the reasons for political education. He also believed that history should be just the facts that would then come from one’s personal experience or eyewitnesses. Polybius, during his reviews of other historians, often criticized them for lack of political and military knowledge.

> “the soundest education and training for a life of active politics is
> the study of history, and that the most vivid, indeed only, teacher of
> how to bear the vicissitudes of fortune bravely is the recollection of
> other people’s calamities.” (Aristotle 1.1252a, McGing, 209)

This opinion corresponds to the rising belief of this time about the benefits of pragmatic history. Through the collective works of the time, a simple definition would entail the telling of the tale through political and military events as _praxeis_, meaning deeds. This mode of writing would make sense as the audience for these works would be reserved for privileged and powerful citizens who often ended up within political or military roles.

## Universal History
With Rome conquering every power within its grasp, Polybius suggested that it was now possible to write a universal history. He expresses his view by saying "anyone who thinks that they can understand the whole of history by reading monographs on individual subjects is like the person who thinks he can appreciate the beauty and grace of a live animal from looking at the different parts of its dissected corpse” (Polybius 1.4; McGing, 155). Polybius believed that partial history or case studies did not contribute at all to the learning of history as these did not help to explain the rest of the world further.

>   “It is only by the interweaving and comparison of all the parts with
> each other than noting their resemblances and differences, we reach a
> stage where we are able to do a general review and thus derive both
> benefit and pleasure from history.” (McGing, 156)

Throughout *Histories* Polybius expresses his hatred for monographs, the detailed study of a single subject or event. This is because he believed that the historian would never be able to understand the world as a whole through these means. Through these universal histories, he explained political entities, events, and geography and used this to explain how actions within one city-state would affect others (McGing, 156). This new historical theory might have been thought about as Greek City-states were declining under the power of Rome as they were spreading their influence across the world. It was through his work of universal histories that he hoped to achieve a way to explain how the land was conquered by the Romans by describing the events that lead to the weakening of the city-state.

>  “In earlier times the world’s history had consisted, so to speak, of
> a series of unrelated episodes, the origins and results of each being
> as widely separated as their localities, but from this point [the
> 140th Olympiad: 220–216 BC] onwards, history becomes an organic whole
> [somatoeides]: the affairs of Italy and Africa are connected with
> [inter-linked with – symplekesthai] those of Asia and Greece, and all
> events bear a relationship and contribute to a single end.” (Eckstein, 330)
