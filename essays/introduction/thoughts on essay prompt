I’m working through some different topics that I feel could be something with Historiography and making sure that it focuses of the significance on why it was written and not just a basic history paper. I wanted to work on sports history and the significance on how in the last 30 years it has become much more important to many in recording and documenting it. But as we discussed in class this topic would be very hard to research. I want of focus on something in American History, I’ve taken a lot of classes on Slavery, the American West and, and Political Science. In the meantime I will set up a time to rework this topic with Dr. Gibbs and update this page for the first draft that will be due in two weeks from Monday.
