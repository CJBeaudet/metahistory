title: What is Historiography?
subtitle: Disentangling the past from our stories about it
author: Fred Gibbs
toc-blurb: While reading history often seems like an adventure into the past, it never fully leaves the present. Yet the ways in which existing power structures, political ideologies, personal interests, cultural criticism, and professional conventions impose on our narratives (and even the narrative form itself) and interpretations of the past are rarely obvious. Historiography examines what these are and shows why they are indispensable for any critical reading of history.

Simply put, historiography is the study of the writing of history. This means studying how history has been written in the past, how and why it changed, and contemporary approaches to writing history.

This seems straightforward enough,

While reading history often seems like an adventure into the past, it never fully leaves the present. Yet the ways in which existing power structures, political ideologies, personal interests, cultural criticism, and professional conventions impose on our narratives (and even the narrative form itself) and interpretations of the past are rarely obvious. Historiography, then, in the sense of a general considerations of the forces of production of historical writing, remains indispensable for any critical reading of history.

Two important questions must guide any analysis of historical writing: **What is history for?** and **Who is history for?** Essays show through careful synthesis of secondary sources and copious references to primary sources how this question can and perhaps should be answered at various periods throughout history. They emphasize the forest rather than the trees; readers curious for more detail can pursue the topic through the bibliographies for further reading at the end of each essay.
