{:.abstract}

Early Soviet historiography was shaped by various conflicts, Russian Revolution of 1905, February and October Revolutions of 1917, Russian Civil War, as well as political controversies of Soviet Party leadership. Starting in the late nineteenth century, Russians began to embrace the ideas of Marxism, which helped create change in society and country leadership. The main figure in this early change was the revolutionary leader, Vladimir Lenin. Lenin was the central character which all of society, including historiography, would revolve around through his own will and through the will of the Communist Party that he helped found and lead.

A great deal of Soviet historiography has to do with the role of Marxism. Many historians adopted Marxist ideologies and tried to fit their views into not only Soviet history, but Russian history as a whole. This essay seeks to explore several historians (including one would be historian), institutions, and how they attempted to justify their actions during the aforementioned conflicts and the power of resulting government.


## Marxists and non-Marxists
The entirety of post revolution Soviet society was supposed to be built on Marxism but it was not a simple task to rid non-Marxists from educational institutions. The Soviet Marxists were guided by the principles of Marxism-Leninism which was an evolutionary process that was built on a series of socioeconomic formations including primitive communism, slave-holding society, feudalism, capitalism, and communism. Marxist historians preferred to not work with non-Marxists because they felt that the non-Marxists could still be a threat to the Communist Party through their interpretations of history. The Communist Party allowed the non-Marxists to continue their work, but it heavily monitored. Several competing institutions of both ideologies were created to formulate Soviet history, with Marxist leadership.

The Marxist institutions included, the Society of Marxist Historians (part of the Communist Academy), the Commission for the Study of the October Revolution, and the Russian Communist Party (Istpar), and the Institute of Red Professors. All of these institutions had the main mission of promoting Marxist history and were headed by M.N. Pokrovsky. These institutions were used to collect materials pertaining to party history, have historical discussions, and to contain non-Marxist histories.

The non- and semi-Marxist institutions includes the Academy of Sciences in Leningrad, GAIMK (State Academy for the History of Material Culture), and RANION (Russian Association of Social Science Institutes). The state sanctioned institutions were used to allow bourgeois scholarship to continue in a controlled environment where all works could be edited to the Communist Party’s liking.

### Leon Trotsky
Leon Trotsky was a leading Russian revolutionary and not a trained historian but he had great contributions to the study of history. Trotsky’s main focus was on the October Revolution of 1917. His first work on the subject was a historical pamphlet, History of the Russian Revolution to Brest-Litovsk, about the October Revolution that sought to justify the actions of the Bolsheviks. Trotsky wanted to show that the Bolsheviks were not usurpers of power and they were successful because their revolution was inevitable, through the lens of Marxism, and they had wide support of the people. This pamphlet became an early official history of the Revolution which defined how all others were to be written.

After falling out of favor with the party and getting deported from the USSR, Trotsky wrote some of his most seminal works including The History of the Russian Revolution and My Life. Trotsky’s History was the preeminent historical work that took into account the entire Revolution from February to October. His underlying purpose was to elevate his position as being the other true leader of the revolution alongside Lenin and to call out other Soviet leaders, especially Stalin, as being unworthy of leading.

### Stalin and the Short Course
In 1931 Joseph Stalin wrote a letter to Proletarskaia Revoliutsiia (Proletarian Revolution) criticizing the way historians, A. G. Slutskii and Volosevich, portrayed Lenin and Party history. This would not be the last time Stalin and party members would intervene in the writing of history. A main criticism Stalin had was the way previous histories were framed chronologically. Stalin called for a new textbook to be written, under his framework, with the party’s guidance that would focus on the history of the party. In 1938 the textbook was published titled History of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks): Short Course.

The Short Course was supposed to be a textbook that exemplified the Marxist theory of history by speaking to the collective as drivers of history but ended up elevating individuals, Lenin and Stalin, as the creators of history. The Short Course made Stalin into the hero of the Soviet Union which further solidified his standing with the public.

The Short Course became the basis of all Soviet history and was supposed to be used by all Soviets and non-Soviets alike as a guide to Leninism-Marxism. It was distributed and taught throughout the government and education system. No other histories were allowed to be produced without the consent of the party


### Conclusion: Stalinist Repudiation
Not long after the death of Stalin in 1953 did the Short Course fall out of favor. When Nikita Khrushchev came into power, he called for new history books to be created and for the Short Course to be removed from educational institutions. Khrushchev's efforts to destalinize Soviet society helped the profession of history by allowing historians, including a few outsiders, to finally reenter the archives that were shut during Stalin's reign.
