Within this essay I plan on looking at the historigraphic impact of Polybius's ideas and work through looking at his book " The Histories". In doing so, compairing the before and after methidologies of historriography to see the amount of imediate impact he has. In this essay I plan going through brief background history as well so that this paper will be usable and easy to understand for freshmen. This will include questions like: What is Historiography, how was Historiography practiced prior, who was Polybius, what was his work, what was the history behind what he wrote about, how did his work change the view of historiography, and the most important question, why does this matter/ why should we care?
