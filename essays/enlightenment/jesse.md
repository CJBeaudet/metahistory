In my essay for this class I would like to research and discuss the effect of the individualist movement on the writing of history in general. How has individual bias affected history writing and was there a significant change in the writing of history before and after the individualist movement? What do the historic writings look like during the individualist movement look like? And does America still embody individualist principles in our writing? I think the main difficulty in this project will not be finding sources about individualism but rather relating them to historiography. So I am up to having criticism on weather this project will be fruitful or not. One source that I have found on this topic is "American Individualism" written by Herbert Hoover. He explores the future and past of individualism in the world and in America itself. Again, relating this to historiography may be tough. I would also like to somehow relate the individualized pioneers to historiography. Perhaps through reading their personal diaries and reports? Regardless, I think this would be an interesting topic if I can find connection between it and historiography.
